      <h1>Kill Fee Clause: Why Every Creator Needs One</h1>
<p><em>Last updated: February 2026</em></p>
<p>You&#39;ve signed the contract. Blocked your calendar. Started researching the brand. Maybe even shot some test footage.</p>
<p>Then: &quot;Hey, we&#39;ve decided to go in a different direction. Thanks anyway!&quot;</p>
<p>Without a kill fee clause, you just worked for free.</p>
<hr>
<h2>What Is a Kill Fee?</h2>
<p>A kill fee (also called a cancellation fee) is compensation you receive when a client cancels a project after you&#39;ve committed to it.</p>
<p>It protects you from:</p>
<ul>
<li>Brands changing their mind after you&#39;ve started work</li>
<li>Budget cuts that leave you holding the bag</li>
<li>Internal reshuffles that kill campaigns mid-production</li>
<li>Brands ghosting after receiving drafts</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>The principle:</strong> Your time has value. Once you commit to a project, you&#39;ve blocked out your schedule and potentially turned down other work. Compensation should reflect that.</p>
<hr>
<h2>Why Brands Cancel Projects</h2>
<p>It happens more than you&#39;d think:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Budget cuts</strong> — Marketing budget gets slashed mid-quarter</li>
<li><strong>Strategy pivot</strong> — New CMO wants to go a different direction</li>
<li><strong>Product delays</strong> — Launch pushed back, content no longer needed</li>
<li><strong>Internal politics</strong> — Project loses its champion</li>
<li><strong>They got cold feet</strong> — Saw the draft and panicked</li>
<li><strong>They were just &quot;testing&quot;</strong> — Never serious in the first place</li>
</ul>
<p>None of these are your fault. All of them cost you time and money.</p>
<hr>
<h2>Standard Kill Fee Structure</h2>
<p>Here&#39;s the industry-standard approach:</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>Cancellation Point</th>
<th>Fee Due</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody><tr>
<td>After signing, before work begins</td>
<td>0-15%</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>After work begins, before draft</td>
<td>25-35%</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>After draft delivery</td>
<td>50%</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>After final delivery</td>
<td>100%</td>
</tr>
</tbody></table>
<h3>Breakdown</h3>
<p><strong>After signing, before work begins (0-15%)</strong></p>
<p>You&#39;ve committed but haven&#39;t invested significant time yet. Some creators charge nothing here; others charge a small booking fee to cover the opportunity cost of holding their schedule.</p>
<p><strong>After work begins, before draft (25-35%)</strong></p>
<p>You&#39;ve started research, planning, potentially shooting test footage. Real work has happened. 25-35% compensates for that investment.</p>
<p><strong>After draft delivery (50%)</strong></p>
<p>You&#39;ve created the content. It exists. They&#39;ve seen it. 50% is fair because you&#39;ve done most of the work, but they&#39;re not getting final deliverables.</p>
<p><strong>After final delivery (100%)</strong></p>
<p>The work is done. You delivered. They owe you the full amount, period.</p>
<hr>
<h2>Kill Fee Clause Examples</h2>
<h3>Simple Version</h3>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Cancellation Policy:</strong> If Client terminates this agreement after signing, the following fees apply: Before draft delivery: 25% of total fee. After draft delivery: 50% of total fee. After final delivery: 100% of total fee.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3>Detailed Version</h3>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>7. CANCELLATION AND KILL FEE</strong></p>
<p>7.1 Client may terminate this agreement at any time by providing written notice to Creator.</p>
<p>7.2 Upon termination, Client shall pay Creator the following cancellation fees:</p>
<ul>
<li>(a) Termination before Creator begins work: No fee due, less deposit (if any)</li>
<li>(b) Termination after work begins, before draft delivery: 25% of total agreed fee</li>
<li>(c) Termination after draft delivery, before final approval: 50% of total agreed fee  </li>
<li>(d) Termination after final delivery: 100% of total agreed fee</li>
</ul>
<p>7.3 &quot;Draft delivery&quot; means the first submission of content to Client for review.</p>
<p>7.4 Kill fee is due within 14 days of termination notice.</p>
<p>7.5 Upon payment of applicable kill fee, Client receives no license to any created content.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3>Agency Version (More Protective)</h3>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Cancellation:</strong> This agreement may be cancelled by either party with 7 days written notice. Upon cancellation:</p>
<ul>
<li>Creator retains all deposits paid</li>
<li>Client pays for work completed at time-and-materials rate ($X/hour)</li>
<li>Minimum cancellation fee: 25% of total contract value</li>
<li>After draft approval: 75% of total contract value due</li>
<li>Client receives no usage rights to any content created</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<hr>
<h2>How to Negotiate Kill Fees</h2>
<h3>If the Brand Pushes Back</h3>
<p><strong>They say:</strong> &quot;We can&#39;t agree to pay for work we don&#39;t receive.&quot;</p>
<p><strong>You say:</strong> &quot;The kill fee compensates for my time and the opportunity cost of blocking my schedule. I may have turned down other projects to accommodate this one. It also protects both of us — it ensures you&#39;re committed to the project, and I&#39;m committed to delivering.&quot;</p>
<p><strong>They say:</strong> &quot;We&#39;ve never paid a kill fee before.&quot;</p>
<p><strong>You say:</strong> &quot;Professional creators include cancellation protection in their contracts. It&#39;s industry standard, similar to how hotels charge for late cancellations. I&#39;m happy to discuss the specific terms, but some form of protection needs to be included.&quot;</p>
<p><strong>They say:</strong> &quot;What if we just don&#39;t like the content?&quot;</p>
<p><strong>You say:</strong> &quot;That&#39;s what the revision process is for. The kill fee covers cancellation — meaning you&#39;ve decided not to move forward with the project at all, not that you want changes. If you&#39;d like revisions, those are included.&quot;</p>
<h3>When to Be Flexible</h3>
<ul>
<li>Long-term client relationships (reduce percentages slightly)</li>
<li>Very large contracts (may negotiate lower percentages on higher absolute values)</li>
<li>Trusted brands with track records</li>
</ul>
<h3>When to Hold Firm</h3>
<ul>
<li>First-time clients</li>
<li>Brands with questionable reputation</li>
<li>Complex or time-intensive projects</li>
<li>Rush projects where you blocked other work</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<h2>What Happens to the Content?</h2>
<p>This matters. Clarify in your contract:</p>
<p><strong>Option 1: No Rights Transfer</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Upon payment of kill fee, Client receives no license to any content created. Creator retains all rights and may repurpose content as they see fit.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is the standard approach. They cancelled — they don&#39;t get the content.</p>
<p><strong>Option 2: Limited Rights at Higher Fee</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Upon payment of kill fee at 75% or above, Client receives a non-exclusive license to use draft content for internal purposes only. No public use permitted.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Some brands want this option. Charge more for it.</p>
<p><strong>Option 3: Full Rights at Full Payment</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Upon payment of 100% of contract value as kill fee, Client receives all rights as originally agreed.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If they pay in full, they get what they paid for.</p>

<h2>Real-World Kill Fee Scenarios</h2>
<h3>Scenario 1: Early Cancellation</h3>
<p><strong>Situation:</strong> You&#39;ve signed a $500 contract. Brand emails the next day saying they&#39;ve changed their mind.</p>
<p><strong>Kill fee:</strong> 0-15% = $0-75</p>
<p><strong>Outcome:</strong> You&#39;re out one day of time. Move on, lesson learned about vetting clients.</p>
<h3>Scenario 2: Mid-Project Cancellation</h3>
<p><strong>Situation:</strong> You&#39;ve researched the brand, planned your shots, and filmed 2 of 3 videos. Brand says budget got cut.</p>
<p><strong>Kill fee:</strong> 25-35% = $125-175</p>
<p><strong>Outcome:</strong> Doesn&#39;t cover all your time, but provides some compensation. You keep the footage for your portfolio.</p>
<h3>Scenario 3: After Draft Delivery</h3>
<p><strong>Situation:</strong> You&#39;ve completed all 3 videos and sent for approval. Brand says they&#39;re &quot;going in a different direction.&quot;</p>
<p><strong>Kill fee:</strong> 50% = $250</p>
<p><strong>Outcome:</strong> Fair compensation. The work exists. They could theoretically use it, so 50% protects both parties.</p>
<h3>Scenario 4: They Ghost After Final Delivery</h3>
<p><strong>Situation:</strong> You delivered final, unwatermarked videos. Brand stops responding to emails.</p>
<p><strong>Kill fee:</strong> 100% = $500</p>
<p><strong>Outcome:</strong> Chase payment. Send invoices. Document everything. This is breach of contract.</p>

<h2>Kill Fee Best Practices</h2>
<h3>1. Get Deposit Upfront</h3>
<p>A 50% deposit reduces your risk. Even if they cancel, you&#39;ve already been partially paid.</p>
<h3>2. Use Watermarked Previews</h3>
<p>Never send final, unwatermarked content until you have payment (or until contract is well-established with trusted client).</p>
<h3>3. Define &quot;Draft&quot; Clearly</h3>
<p>What exactly counts as draft delivery? First submission? First revision? Be specific to avoid disputes.</p>
<h3>4. Put It in Every Contract</h3>
<p>Even for small projects. Especially for new clients. The one time you skip it will be the time you need it.</p>
<h3>5. Invoice Promptly on Cancellation</h3>
<p>When they cancel, send the kill fee invoice immediately with clear reference to the contract clause.</p>
<hr>
<h2>What If They Refuse to Pay?</h2>
<p>Steps to take:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Send formal invoice</strong> referencing contract clause</li>
<li><strong>Follow up</strong> in 7 days, then 14 days</li>
<li><strong>Send demand letter</strong> (template available online)</li>
<li><strong>Report to creator communities</strong> (optional, but valid)</li>
<li><strong>Small claims court</strong> (for larger amounts)</li>
</ol>
<p>Document everything. Screenshots of the contract, all communications, the cancellation notice.</p>
<hr>
<h2>Kill Fee Checklist</h2>
<p>Before signing any contract, verify:</p>
<ul>
<li><input disabled="" type="checkbox"> Kill fee clause is included</li>
<li><input disabled="" type="checkbox"> Percentages are defined at each stage</li>
<li><input disabled="" type="checkbox"> &quot;Draft delivery&quot; is clearly defined</li>
<li><input disabled="" type="checkbox"> Payment timeline for kill fee is specified</li>
<li><input disabled="" type="checkbox"> Content rights upon cancellation are addressed</li>
<li><input disabled="" type="checkbox"> You&#39;re getting at least 25% upfront as deposit</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>A kill fee isn&#39;t about punishing brands. It&#39;s about respecting your time and creating fair terms for both parties.</p>
<p>Any professional brand will understand and accept reasonable cancellation terms. If they don&#39;t, that tells you everything about how they&#39;ll treat you during the project.</p>
<p>Protect yourself. Put it in writing. Get paid for your commitment.</p>
