<h2>Email Templates for Specific Situations</h2>
<h3>&quot;We&#39;re Having Cash Flow Issues&quot;</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>Hi [Name],</p>
<p>I appreciate you letting me know about the situation. I understand businesses go through difficult periods.</p>
<p>That said, the work was completed and delivered as agreed. I&#39;d like to propose a payment plan:</p>
<ul>
<li>50% ($[X]) by [DATE]</li>
<li>50% ($[X]) by [DATE]</li>

<p>Please confirm this arrangement works, or suggest an alternative timeline that you can commit to.</p>
<p>Regards,
[Your name]</p>
</blockquote>
<h3>&quot;The Invoice Is With Finance&quot;</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>Hi [Name],</p>
<p>Thanks for the update. Could you provide:</p>
<ol>
<li>The expected processing time</li>
<li>A contact in finance I can follow up with directly</li>
</ol>
<p>I&#39;ll mark [DATE] to check back if I haven&#39;t received payment by then.</p>
<p>Thanks,
[Your name]</p>
</blockquote>
<h3>&quot;We&#39;re Not Happy With the Content&quot;</h3>

<p>Hi [Name],</p>
<p>I&#39;m sorry to hear you&#39;re not satisfied. Per our agreement, the revision process was the time to address any concerns — which we completed on [DATE].</p>

<h2>Pro Tips for Chasing Payments</h2>
<h3>Always Be Professional</h3>
<p>Angry emails feel satisfying. They don&#39;t get you paid. Keep every communication professional — it may end up in court.</p>
<h3>Document Everything</h3>
<p>Save every email, every agreement, every delivery confirmation. Screenshot DMs before they disappear.</p>
<h3>Try Multiple Contacts</h3>
<p>Your marketing contact might not have payment authority. Try:</p>
<ul>
<li>Accounts Payable email</li>
<li>Finance department</li>
<li>CEO or founder (LinkedIn works)</li>
<li>General company email</li>
</ul>
<h3>Invoice Immediately</h3>
<p>Don&#39;t wait weeks after delivery to invoice. Send it the same day you deliver final content.</p>
<h3>Include Payment Terms on Invoice</h3>
<p>Every invoice should state:</p>
<ul>
<li>Due date</li>
<li>Late fee policy (from your contract)</li>
<li>Payment methods accepted</li>
</ul>
<h3>Consider Payment Upfront</h3>
<p>For new clients, 100% upfront (or 50% deposit) eliminates the chase entirely. Offer this for smaller projects.</p>
<hr>
<h2>When to Escalate to Small Claims</h2>
<p><strong>Consider small claims when:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Amount is significant ($500+)</li>
<li>You have clear documentation (contract, invoice, delivery proof)</li>
<li>They&#39;ve refused to pay or ghosted completely</li>
<li>Amount is within small claims limit (varies by state, usually $5,000-$10,000)</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Small claims basics:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Filing fee: $30-100</li>
<li>No lawyer needed</li>
<li>You represent yourself</li>
<li>Bring all documentation</li>
<li>Judgment is enforceable</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Warning:</strong> Even with a judgment, collecting can be difficult from some companies. Weigh the time investment.</p>
<hr>
<h2>Prevention Is Better Than Cure</h2>
<h3>In Your Contract</h3>
<ul>
<li>Net 15 or Net 30 (not &quot;upon completion&quot;)</li>
<li>5% monthly late fee</li>
<li>Kill fee for cancellations</li>
<li>Deposit required (50% or 100% for new clients)</li>
</ul>
<h3>In Your Process</h3>
<ul>
<li>Vet new clients before signing</li>
<li>Invoice same day as delivery</li>
<li>Use watermarked previews until payment/approval</li>
<li>Track all invoices in a spreadsheet</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<h2>Late Payment Email Checklist</h2>
<p>Before sending:</p>
<ul>
<li><input disabled="" type="checkbox"> Reference specific invoice number</li>
<li><input disabled="" type="checkbox"> State exact amount due</li>
<li><input disabled="" type="checkbox"> Include original due date</li>
<li><input disabled="" type="checkbox"> Calculate days overdue</li>
<li><input disabled="" type="checkbox"> Attach invoice copy</li>
<li><input disabled="" type="checkbox"> Include payment link/details</li>
<li><input disabled="" type="checkbox"> Set clear deadline for response</li>
<li><input disabled="" type="checkbox"> Keep tone professional</li>
<li><input disabled="" type="checkbox"> CC relevant parties if escalating</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>Chasing payments is uncomfortable but necessary. The key is having a system:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Friendly reminder</strong> at 3 days</li>
<li><strong>Direct follow-up</strong> at 7 days</li>
<li><strong>Firm request</strong> at 14 days</li>
<li><strong>Final notice</strong> at 21 days</li>
<li><strong>Demand letter</strong> at 30 days</li>
</ol>
<p>Stay professional, document everything, and don&#39;t be afraid to escalate. Your work has value — fight for it.</p>
