      <h1>10 Clauses Every Creator Contract Needs</h1>
<p><em>Last updated: February 2026</em></p>
<p>That contract you&#39;re about to sign? It&#39;s probably missing something important.</p>
<p>Most creator contracts — whether sent by brands or copied from a free template — leave out critical protections. One missing clause can cost you thousands of dollars or leave your content being used in ways you never agreed to.</p>
<p>Here are the 10 clauses that belong in every creator contract, explained in plain English.</p>
<hr>
<h2>1. Scope of Work (The &quot;What Exactly Am I Doing?&quot; Clause)</h2>
<p><strong>Why it matters:</strong> Prevents scope creep and &quot;can you just add one more thing?&quot; syndrome.</p>
<p><strong>What to include:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Exact number of deliverables</li>
<li>Content format (video, photo, stories, etc.)</li>
<li>Platform specifications</li>
<li>Length/duration requirements</li>
<li>Specific products or topics covered</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Bad example:</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;Creator will produce content for Brand&#39;s social media channels.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Good example:</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;Creator will produce 3 vertical videos (9:16 aspect ratio, 1080x1920, 20-30 seconds each) featuring [Product Name] for use on TikTok and Instagram Reels. Content will demonstrate [specific use case].&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>The rule:</strong> If it&#39;s not written, it&#39;s not included.</p>
<hr>
<h2>2. Revision Limits (The &quot;No Endless Changes&quot; Clause)</h2>
<p><strong>Why it matters:</strong> Without this, brands can request unlimited revisions until your content looks nothing like your style.</p>
<p><strong>What to include:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Number of included revision rounds (2 is standard)</li>
<li>Definition of what counts as a revision vs. new content</li>
<li>Fee for additional revisions</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Example clause:</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;Scope includes up to 2 rounds of revisions based on Client feedback. Each additional revision round will be billed at $[X]. Requests for new concepts or complete re-shoots constitute new deliverables and will be quoted separately.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Pro tip:</strong> Feedback must be consolidated. &quot;I&#39;ll send notes throughout the week&quot; is not one revision round — it&#39;s chaos.</p>
<hr>
<h2>3. Payment Terms (The &quot;When Do I Get Paid?&quot; Clause)</h2>
<p><strong>Why it matters:</strong> &quot;Payment upon completion&quot; means nothing if they never define completion.</p>
<p><strong>What to include:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Total compensation amount</li>
<li>Payment schedule (50% upfront / 50% on delivery is standard)</li>
<li>Payment method</li>
<li>Invoice timeline (Net 15, Net 30)</li>
<li>Late payment penalties</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Example clause:</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;Total compensation: $[X]. Payment schedule: 50% ($[X]) due upon signing, 50% ($[X]) due within 7 days of final delivery. Late payments will incur a 5% monthly fee. Payment via [PayPal/bank transfer].&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Never do:</strong> 100% on completion with a new client. Always get something upfront.</p>
<hr>
<h2>4. Usage Rights (The &quot;How Can They Use My Content?&quot; Clause)</h2>
<p><strong>Why it matters:</strong> This determines whether your $300 TikTok ends up in a $50,000 ad campaign — and whether you get paid for it.</p>
<p><strong>What to include:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Platforms where content can be used</li>
<li>Organic vs. paid advertising rights</li>
<li>Duration of license (6 months, 12 months, perpetual)</li>
<li>Geographic scope</li>
<li>Exclusivity or non-exclusivity</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Usage tiers (price accordingly):</strong></p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>Usage Type</th>
<th>Description</th>
<th>Price Impact</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody><tr>
<td>Organic</td>
<td>Brand&#39;s social feeds only</td>
<td>Base rate</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Whitelisting</td>
<td>Paid ads from creator&#39;s account</td>
<td>+50-100%</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Paid (brand account)</td>
<td>Paid ads from brand&#39;s account</td>
<td>+30-50%</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Extended term</td>
<td>Beyond 12 months</td>
<td>+25-50% per year</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Perpetual</td>
<td>Forever</td>
<td>+100-200%</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Exclusive</td>
<td>You can&#39;t reuse or show it</td>
<td>+200%+</td>
</tr>
</tbody></table>
<p><strong>Example clause:</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;Client receives a non-exclusive license to use the Content on their owned Instagram and TikTok accounts for organic posting for a period of 12 months from delivery. Usage in paid advertising, on additional platforms, or beyond 12 months requires separate written agreement and additional compensation.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<hr>
<h2>5. Kill Fee (The &quot;What If They Cancel?&quot; Clause)</h2>
<p><strong>Why it matters:</strong> You blocked your schedule, researched the brand, and started creating. If they pull the plug, you deserve compensation.</p>
<p><strong>What to include:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Percentage of fee due at each stage of cancellation</li>
<li>Clear definitions of each stage</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Example clause:</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;If Client terminates this agreement:</p>
<ul>
<li>Before Creator begins work: No fee due</li>
<li>After work begins, before draft delivery: 25% of total fee due</li>
<li>After draft delivery, before final approval: 50% of total fee due  </li>
<li>After final delivery: 100% of total fee due&quot;</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Why brands accept this:</strong> Professional brands understand this. If they balk at a kill fee, that&#39;s a red flag about how they treat creators.</p>
<hr>
<h2>6. Content Ownership (The &quot;Who Owns What?&quot; Clause)</h2>
<p><strong>Why it matters:</strong> Clarifies rights to raw footage, outtakes, and whether you can use the work in your portfolio.</p>
<p><strong>What to include:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Who owns raw footage</li>
<li>Who owns final delivered content</li>
<li>Your right to use in portfolio/self-promotion</li>
<li>What happens to unused concepts</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Example clause:</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;Creator retains ownership of all raw footage, outtakes, and unused concepts. Client receives a license (as defined in Usage Rights) to the final delivered Content only. Creator may use final Content in their portfolio and social media unless otherwise agreed in writing.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Watch out for:</strong> &quot;Work for hire&quot; language gives the brand full ownership of everything, including stuff you haven&#39;t created yet.</p>
<hr>
<h2>7. Exclusivity (The &quot;Can I Work With Competitors?&quot; Clause)</h2>
<p><strong>Why it matters:</strong> Long exclusivity periods lock you out of income without compensation.</p>
<p><strong>What to include:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Duration of exclusivity (30 days is reasonable, 6 months is aggressive)</li>
<li>Definition of &quot;competitor&quot; </li>
<li>Additional compensation for extended exclusivity</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Example clause:</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;Creator agrees not to create sponsored content for direct competitors of Client for 30 days following final delivery. &#39;Direct competitor&#39; means [specific category] brands. Extended exclusivity available at $[X] per additional month.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Rule of thumb:</strong> Exclusivity over 30 days should come with significant extra payment.</p>
<hr>
<h2>8. Approval Process (The &quot;How Do We Sign Off?&quot; Clause)</h2>
<p><strong>Why it matters:</strong> Prevents &quot;well, I never officially approved it&quot; disputes and establishes clear timelines.</p>
<p><strong>What to include:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Timeline for client feedback</li>
<li>What happens if they don&#39;t respond</li>
<li>Format for delivering feedback</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Example clause:</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;Client has 3 business days to provide consolidated feedback on each draft. Failure to respond within 3 business days constitutes approval. All feedback must be provided in writing (email acceptable).&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Pro tip:</strong> &quot;Failure to respond = approval&quot; protects you from clients who ghost mid-project.</p>
<hr>
<h2>9. Confidentiality (The &quot;What Can I Talk About?&quot; Clause)</h2>
<p><strong>Why it matters:</strong> Some brands require NDAs. You need to know what you can and can&#39;t share.</p>
<p><strong>What to include:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>What&#39;s considered confidential</li>
<li>What you can share publicly (behind-the-scenes, partnership announcements)</li>
<li>Duration of confidentiality</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Example clause:</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;Creator agrees to keep confidential any non-public product information, launch dates, and strategy details shared during this engagement. Creator may announce the partnership on their social channels after [date] and share behind-the-scenes content with Client approval.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> Reasonable confidentiality is fine. &quot;You can never mention you worked with us&quot; is weird — avoid it.</p>
<hr>
<h2>10. Dispute Resolution (The &quot;What If Something Goes Wrong?&quot; Clause)</h2>
<p><strong>Why it matters:</strong> Hopefully you never need this, but if things go south, you want a clear path forward.</p>
<p><strong>What to include:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Governing law (which state/country&#39;s laws apply)</li>
<li>Resolution method (mediation, arbitration, or courts)</li>
<li>Who pays for dispute resolution</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Example clause:</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;This agreement shall be governed by the laws of [State/Country]. Any disputes arising from this agreement shall first be addressed through good-faith negotiation, then mediation, before pursuing legal action.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<hr>
<h2>Bonus: The &quot;Red Flags&quot; Clause Checklist</h2>
<p>If a brand&#39;s contract includes any of these, push back:</p>
<p>🚩 <strong>Unlimited revisions</strong> — Counter with 2 rounds included<br>🚩 <strong>Perpetual, royalty-free, worldwide license</strong> — Negotiate time limits or extra pay<br>🚩 <strong>Work for hire</strong> — Counter with license-based language<br>🚩 <strong>Payment upon campaign completion</strong> — Get specific dates and partial upfront<br>🚩 <strong>6+ month exclusivity without extra pay</strong> — Negotiate shorter or more money<br>🚩 <strong>Indemnification</strong> — Understand what you&#39;re agreeing to cover  </p>
<hr>
<h2>Your Contract Clause Checklist</h2>
<p>Before signing, verify your contract includes:</p>
<ul>
<li><input disabled="" type="checkbox"> Specific scope of work with deliverable counts</li>
<li><input disabled="" type="checkbox"> Revision limits with overage fees</li>
<li><input disabled="" type="checkbox"> Payment amount, schedule, and late fee policy</li>
<li><input disabled="" type="checkbox"> Usage rights with platform, duration, and paid/organic terms</li>
<li><input disabled="" type="checkbox"> Kill fee for cancellations</li>
<li><input disabled="" type="checkbox"> Content ownership and portfolio rights</li>
<li><input disabled="" type="checkbox"> Reasonable exclusivity terms</li>
<li><input disabled="" type="checkbox"> Approval process and timelines</li>
<li><input disabled="" type="checkbox"> Confidentiality terms you can live with</li>
<li><input disabled="" type="checkbox"> Dispute resolution process</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>These 10 clauses aren&#39;t legal overkill — they&#39;re basic protection. The best time to negotiate is before you&#39;ve done the work, not after you&#39;re chasing payment.</p>
<p>A professional brand will respect a creator who knows their worth and protects their work. If they don&#39;t? That tells you everything you need to know.</p>
