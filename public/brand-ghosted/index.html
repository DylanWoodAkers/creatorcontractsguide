      <h1>What to Do When a Brand Ghosts You</h1>
<p><em>Last updated: February 2026</em></p>
<p>You delivered the content. Sent the invoice. And then... silence.</p>
<p>Days turn into weeks. Emails go unanswered. The brand that was so enthusiastic during negotiations has vanished.</p>
<p>Getting ghosted by a brand is frustratingly common. Here&#39;s exactly what to do about it.</p>
<hr>
<h2>Why Brands Ghost</h2>
<p>Understanding the reasons helps you respond appropriately:</p>
<h3>Benign Reasons</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Overwhelmed contact</strong> — Your point person is buried and your invoice isn&#39;t priority</li>
<li><strong>Internal approval delays</strong> — Payment has to go through multiple departments</li>
<li><strong>Budget timing</strong> — They can only pay on certain cycles</li>
<li><strong>Staff changes</strong> — Your contact left and no one picked up the project</li>
</ul>
<h3>Concerning Reasons</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Cash flow problems</strong> — They can&#39;t pay right now</li>
<li><strong>Buyer&#39;s remorse</strong> — They regret the deal but won&#39;t say it</li>
<li><strong>Intentional avoidance</strong> — They&#39;re hoping you&#39;ll give up</li>
<li><strong>Scam from the start</strong> — Never intended to pay</li>
</ul>

<h2>Step-by-Step: What to Do</h2>
<h3>Stage 1: The Benefit of the Doubt (Days 1-7)</h3>
<p><strong>Assumption:</strong> They&#39;re busy, not malicious.</p>
<p><strong>Action:</strong> Send a friendly follow-up.</p>
<p><strong>Email template:</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Subject: Following up on [Project Name]</p>
<p>Hi [Name],</p>
<p>Hope you&#39;re doing well! Just following up on [the invoice / our last conversation / the draft I sent].</p>
<p>Let me know if you need anything from my end.</p>
<p>Best,
[Your name]</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>When to send:</strong> 3-5 business days after last contact.</p>
<hr>
<h3>Stage 2: The Clear Ask (Days 7-14)</h3>
<p><strong>Assumption:</strong> Message got lost or deprioritized.</p>
<p><strong>Action:</strong> Be more direct. Request specific response.</p>
<p><strong>Email template:</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Subject: Re: [Project Name] - Action Needed</p>
<p>Hi [Name],</p>
<p>I wanted to follow up again regarding [specific issue - payment/feedback/contract].</p>
<p>Could you confirm:</p>
<ol>
<li>Receipt of [invoice/content/etc.]</li>
<li>Expected timeline for [payment/response]</li>
</ol>
<p>Please let me know by [specific date] so I can update my records.</p>
<p>Thanks,
[Your name]</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Also try:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Different contact at the company</li>
<li>Their official support/finance email</li>
<li>LinkedIn message to your contact</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<h3>Stage 3: The Formal Notice (Days 14-30)</h3>
<p><strong>Assumption:</strong> There&#39;s a real problem.</p>
<p><strong>Action:</strong> Formal communication documenting the issue.</p>
<p><strong>Email template:</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Subject: Formal Notice: Outstanding Payment - [Invoice #]</p>
<p>Dear [Name/Company],</p>
<p>This is a formal notice regarding the outstanding payment for [Project Name].</p>
<p>Details:</p>
<ul>
<li>Invoice #: [Number]</li>
<li>Invoice Date: [Date]</li>
<li>Amount Due: $[Amount]</li>
<li>Due Date: [Original due date]</li>
<li>Days Overdue: [X] days</li>
</ul>
<p>Per our agreement dated [contract date], payment was due within [X] days of delivery. The content was delivered on [delivery date].</p>
<p>Please remit payment within 7 business days to avoid further action.</p>
<p>I have attached copies of:</p>
<ul>
<li>Original contract</li>
<li>Invoice</li>
<li>Delivery confirmation</li>
</ul>
<p>Please confirm receipt of this notice.</p>
<p>Regards,
[Your name]</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Send via:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Email (with read receipt if possible)</li>
<li>Certified mail to company address (for larger amounts)</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<h3>Stage 4: Escalation (Days 30+)</h3>
<p><strong>Assumption:</strong> They&#39;re not going to pay without pressure.</p>
<p><strong>Options:</strong></p>
<p><strong>1. Contact their accounts payable directly</strong>
Find the finance/AP department email. Your contact may not have payment authority.</p>
<p><strong>2. Reach out to leadership</strong>
Find the CEO or Marketing Director on LinkedIn. A professional message about an unpaid invoice often gets fast results.</p>
<p><strong>3. Public accountability (careful here)</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Share (factually) in creator communities</li>
<li>Some creators tweet about non-payment — this can work but burns bridges</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>4. Collections or legal</strong>
For amounts over $500:</p>
<ul>
<li>Send formal demand letter (templates online)</li>
<li>Small claims court ($30-100 filing fee, no lawyer needed)</li>
<li>Collection agency (they take 25-50%, but something &gt; nothing)</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<h2>The Demand Letter</h2>
<p>A demand letter is a formal document that often triggers payment. Many people pay once they realize you&#39;re serious.</p>
<p><strong>Template:</strong></p>
<pre><code>[Your Name]
[Your Address]
[Date]

[Company Name]
[Company Address]

RE: DEMAND FOR PAYMENT

Dear [Company Name],

I am writing to demand payment for services rendered under our agreement dated [Date].

SUMMARY OF CLAIM:
- Services: [Description of work]
- Invoice Amount: $[Amount]
- Invoice Date: [Date]
- Payment Due Date: [Date]
- Amount Currently Owed: $[Amount + any late fees per contract]

Despite multiple attempts to resolve this matter, payment remains outstanding. I have attached copies of the signed agreement, invoice, and delivery confirmation.

DEMAND:
I demand payment in full within 10 days of this letter. If payment is not received by [Date], I will pursue all available legal remedies, including but not limited to:
- Filing in small claims court
- Reporting to credit bureaus
- Publicizing this matter in professional communities

This is not a threat; it is a statement of my intent to exercise my legal rights.

Please remit payment to:
[Payment details]

Sincerely,
[Your Signature]
[Your Name]

<h2>Preventing Future Ghosting</h2>
<h3>Before the Project</h3>
<ol>
<li><strong>Vet the brand</strong> — Search &quot;[brand] + creator + payment&quot; before signing</li>
<li><strong>Require deposits</strong> — 50% upfront is standard. No deposit = no work</li>
<li><strong>Use contracts</strong> — Written agreements are your protection</li>
<li><strong>Set clear payment terms</strong> — Specific dates, not &quot;upon completion&quot;</li>
</ol>
<h3>During the Project</h3>
<ol>
<li><strong>Watermark previews</strong> — Never send final content before payment/approval</li>
<li><strong>Document everything</strong> — Email confirmations, not just DM conversations</li>
<li><strong>Invoice immediately</strong> — Don&#39;t wait weeks after delivery</li>
</ol>
<h3>In Your Contract</h3>
<p>Include these ghost-prevention clauses:</p>
<p><strong>Payment deadline:</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;Payment is due within 15 days of final delivery. Invoices unpaid after 30 days will incur a 5% monthly late fee.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Kill fee:</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;If Client becomes unresponsive for 14+ days during production, Creator may terminate the agreement and invoice for work completed.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Deposit policy:</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;A 50% deposit is required before Creator begins work. Deposit is non-refundable.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<hr>
<h2>What NOT to Do</h2>
<h3>Don&#39;t Threaten Immediately</h3>
<p>Aggressive first emails burn bridges. The contact might just be on vacation.</p>
<h3>Don&#39;t Post Publicly Too Early</h3>
<p>Trashing a brand online before exhausting private options looks unprofessional and can backfire.</p>
<h3>Don&#39;t Give Up Too Easily</h3>
<p>Some creators walk away from hundreds of dollars because follow-up feels awkward. Your work has value. Chase it.</p>
<h3>Don&#39;t Keep Working</h3>
<p>If they ghost mid-project, stop working immediately. No more content until communication resumes.</p>
<hr>
<h2>When to Let It Go</h2>
<p>Sometimes the juice isn&#39;t worth the squeeze:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Amount is very small</strong> (&lt;$100) and time invested in chasing would exceed recovery</li>
<li><strong>Brand is clearly defunct</strong> (website down, social inactive)</li>
<li><strong>You have no contract</strong> — lesson learned, move on</li>
<li><strong>Mental health cost</strong> — some battles aren&#39;t worth fighting</li>
</ul>
<p>But for legitimate amounts with proper documentation? Fight for your money.</p>
<hr>
<h2>Scripts for Common Situations</h2>
<h3>&quot;We&#39;re Still Reviewing Internally&quot;</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;Understood. When can I expect a final decision? I&#39;ll mark [date] on my calendar for follow-up if I haven&#39;t heard back.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<h3>&quot;Budget Got Cut&quot;</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;I understand budget situations change. The work was completed per our agreement, so the invoice remains due. Can we discuss a payment plan if needed?&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<h3>&quot;We Decided Not to Use the Content&quot;</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;I understand. Per our agreement, payment is for the creation and delivery of content, not contingent on use. The invoice remains due.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<h3>No Response at All</h3>
<p>After 30 days, send the demand letter. No more friendly emails.</p>
<hr>
<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>Getting ghosted sucks, but it&#39;s manageable:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Days 1-7:</strong> Friendly follow-up</li>
<li><strong>Days 7-14:</strong> Direct ask with deadline</li>
<li><strong>Days 14-30:</strong> Formal notice</li>
<li><strong>Days 30+:</strong> Escalation (demand letter, small claims)</li>
</ol>
<p>Prevention is better than cure: vet brands, require deposits, use contracts, and never deliver final content before securing payment.</p>
