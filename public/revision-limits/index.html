      <h1>Revision Limits: How Many is Too Many?</h1>
<p><em>Last updated: February 2026</em></p>
<p>&quot;Just one more tweak.&quot;</p>
<p>Famous last words before your $200 project turns into $50/hour work.</p>
<p>Revisions without limits are how creators lose money on every deal. Here&#39;s how to set boundaries that protect your time while still delivering great work.</p>
<hr>
<h2>Why Revision Limits Matter</h2>
<h3>The Math Problem</h3>
<p>Without limits:</p>
<ul>
<li>You quote $300 for a video</li>
<li>You estimate 3 hours of work</li>
<li>That&#39;s $100/hour — great!</li>
</ul>
<p>With &quot;unlimited revisions&quot;:</p>
<ul>
<li>First draft: 3 hours</li>
<li>Revision 1: 1 hour</li>
<li>Revision 2: 1.5 hours</li>
<li>Revision 3: 2 hours</li>
<li>Revision 4: 1 hour</li>
<li>&quot;One more tweak&quot;: 0.5 hours</li>
</ul>
<p>Total: 9 hours. That&#39;s $33/hour.</p>
<p>Suddenly your great rate is below minimum wage for skilled creative work.</p>
<h3>The Psychology Problem</h3>
<p>Unlimited revisions signal:</p>
<ul>
<li>You don&#39;t value your time</li>
<li>The client can keep pushing</li>
<li>&quot;Perfect&quot; is the goal (it never is)</li>
</ul>
<p>Limited revisions signal:</p>
<ul>
<li>Your time has value</li>
<li>There&#39;s a process to follow</li>
<li>Decisions need to be made</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<h2>Industry Standards</h2>
<h3>What&#39;s Normal</h3>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>Creator Level</th>
<th>Included Revisions</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody><tr>
<td>Beginner</td>
<td>2 rounds</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Intermediate</td>
<td>2 rounds</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Established</td>
<td>1-2 rounds</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Premium</td>
<td>1 round</td>
</tr>
</tbody></table>
<p>Yes — the more experienced you are, the fewer revisions you include. Because:</p>
<ol>
<li>Your work is higher quality initially</li>
<li>Your time is more valuable</li>
<li>Clients who work with pros are more decisive</li>
</ol>
<h3>2 Rounds Is Standard</h3>
<p>For most creator work, 2 rounds of revisions is industry standard. This gives clients:</p>
<ul>
<li>Round 1: Major feedback and direction changes</li>
<li>Round 2: Minor tweaks and final polish</li>
</ul>
<p>If the content isn&#39;t right after 2 rounds, either the brief was bad or there&#39;s a bigger problem.</p>
<hr>
<h2>What Counts as a Revision?</h2>
<p>This is where problems happen. Define it clearly.</p>
<h3>A Revision IS:</h3>
<ul>
<li>Feedback on the existing concept</li>
<li>Color correction requests</li>
<li>Text/caption changes</li>
<li>Minor timing adjustments</li>
<li>Audio level tweaks</li>
<li>Small edits to existing footage</li>
</ul>
<h3>A Revision IS NOT:</h3>
<ul>
<li>Complete concept change (&quot;Actually, let&#39;s try something different&quot;)</li>
<li>New script or messaging</li>
<li>Re-shoot with different products</li>
<li>Major structural overhaul</li>
<li>Adding new deliverables</li>
</ul>
<h3>Contract Language</h3>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Definition:</strong> A &quot;revision&quot; means modifications to existing content based on Client feedback. Requests for new concepts, complete re-shoots, additional deliverables, or fundamental changes to creative direction constitute new work and will be quoted separately.</p>
</blockquote>
<hr>
<h2>Structuring Your Revision Process</h2>
<h3>The Feedback Window</h3>
<p>Give clients a deadline to provide feedback:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;Client has 3 business days to provide consolidated feedback on each draft. All feedback must be provided in a single communication (email or document). Feedback received after 3 business days or in multiple communications may be treated as an additional revision round.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Why &quot;consolidated&quot;?</strong> </p>
<p>Without this, clients send 10 emails over 5 days with one note each. That&#39;s chaos, not one revision.</p>
<h3>The Auto-Approval Clause</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;If Creator does not receive feedback within 5 business days of draft delivery, the draft is considered approved. Creator will proceed to final delivery.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This prevents projects from stalling because someone can&#39;t make decisions.</p>
<hr>
<h2>Pricing Additional Revisions</h2>
<h3>Flat Fee Per Round</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;Additional revision rounds: $75 per round&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Pros:</strong> Simple, predictable
<strong>Cons:</strong> May not cover time on complex changes</p>
<h3>Percentage of Project Fee</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;Additional revision rounds: 15% of project total per round&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Pros:</strong> Scales with project size
<strong>Cons:</strong> Math is messier</p>
<h3>Hourly Rate</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;Additional revisions beyond included rounds will be billed at $100/hour&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Pros:</strong> True compensation for time
<strong>Cons:</strong> Client doesn&#39;t know cost upfront</p>
<h3>Recommended</h3>
<p>For most creators: <strong>Flat fee of $50-100 per round</strong> is simple and effective.</p>
<hr>
<h2>Sample Revision Clauses</h2>
<h3>Basic Clause</h3>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Revisions:</strong> This project includes 2 rounds of revisions. Additional revision rounds are available at $75 per round.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3>Detailed Clause</h3>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Revision Policy:</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>Creator will deliver initial draft within [X] days of project start.</li>
<li>Client has 3 business days to provide consolidated written feedback.</li>
<li>Creator will complete revisions within 2 business days of receiving feedback.</li>
<li>This cycle repeats for up to 2 rounds (included in project fee).</li>
<li>Additional revision rounds: $[X] per round.</li>
<li>Requests for new concepts, re-shoots, or fundamental creative changes are not revisions — they are new deliverables and will be quoted separately.</li>
<li>If no feedback is received within 5 business days, content is considered approved.</li>
</ol>
</blockquote>
<h3>Premium Clause (1 Round Only)</h3>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Revisions:</strong> This project includes 1 round of revisions based on a single, consolidated feedback document. </p>
<p>The revision will address specific, actionable notes within the existing creative direction. Requests for conceptual overhauls, new angles, or fundamental changes require a new project scope.</p>
<p>Additional revision rounds: $[X] each, if available in Creator&#39;s schedule.</p>
</blockquote>
<hr>
<h2>Handling Revision Requests</h2>
<h3>When They Want &quot;One More Thing&quot;</h3>
<p><strong>They say:</strong> &quot;Can we just tweak the intro?&quot;</p>
<p><strong>You say:</strong> &quot;We&#39;ve completed our 2 included revision rounds. I can do another revision for $75 — should I proceed?&quot;</p>
<h3>When They Want a Complete Redo</h3>
<p><strong>They say:</strong> &quot;Actually, we want to go in a totally different direction.&quot;</p>
<p><strong>You say:</strong> &quot;A new creative direction would be a separate project from our original scope. I&#39;d be happy to quote that for you. Shall I send a proposal?&quot;</p>
<h3>When Feedback Keeps Trickling In</h3>
<p><strong>They say:</strong> (Email 1) &quot;Can you change the text?&quot;
(Email 2, 3 hours later) &quot;Also the music&quot;
(Email 3, next day) &quot;And maybe try a different hook?&quot;</p>
<p><strong>You say:</strong> &quot;I&#39;d like to address all your feedback in one revision round. Could you send me a consolidated list of everything you&#39;d like changed? I&#39;ll wait for your complete notes before making updates.&quot;</p>
<h3>When They&#39;re Never Satisfied</h3>
<p><strong>Signs:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>4+ revision rounds</li>
<li>Contradictory feedback</li>
<li>&quot;I&#39;ll know it when I see it&quot;</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>You say:</strong> &quot;We&#39;ve gone through several rounds now, and I want to make sure we&#39;re aligned on the vision. Let&#39;s schedule a 15-minute call to discuss exactly what you&#39;re looking for before I make more changes.&quot;</p>
<p>If that doesn&#39;t work:</p>
<ul>
<li>Deliver best version</li>
<li>Invoice in full</li>
<li>Move on</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<h2>Special Cases</h2>
<h3>Hook Variations</h3>
<p>Many brands want multiple hooks for A/B testing. This is NOT a revision — it&#39;s a deliverable.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;Package includes 1 video with 1 hook. Additional hook variations: $[X] each.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Or build it in:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;Package includes 3 hook variations per video.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<h3>Platform Variations</h3>
<p>Different aspect ratios or lengths for different platforms = different deliverables, not revisions.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;Deliverables: 1 video in 9:16 (TikTok/Reels). Additional formats (16:9, 1:1, 4:5): $[X] each.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<h3>Raw Footage Requests</h3>
<p>Not a revision. Separate deliverable.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;Raw footage and B-roll: $[X] for full project footage.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<hr>
<h2>Protecting Yourself</h2>
<h3>Document Everything</h3>
<ul>
<li>Save all feedback emails</li>
<li>Keep version history</li>
<li>Screenshot DM conversations</li>
<li>Track which round you&#39;re on</li>
</ul>
<h3>Be Proactive</h3>
<p>After each revision, confirm:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;I&#39;ve completed the changes based on your feedback. This was revision round [X] of [Y] included. Let me know if this is approved or if you have any final notes!&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This reminds them of limits without being confrontational.</p>
<h3>Know When to Fire Clients</h3>
<p>Some clients will never be happy. Signs:</p>
<ul>
<li>More than 4 revision rounds requested</li>
<li>Feedback contradicts previous feedback</li>
<li>Refusal to consolidate notes</li>
<li>&quot;I can&#39;t describe it but I&#39;ll know it&quot;</li>
</ul>
<p>Your contract protects you. Use it. Deliver the best version you can, invoice, and decline future work.</p>
<hr>
<h2>Revision Clause Checklist</h2>
<p>Your contract should specify:</p>
<ul>
<li><input disabled="" type="checkbox"> Number of included revision rounds (recommend: 2)</li>
<li><input disabled="" type="checkbox"> Definition of &quot;revision&quot; vs. &quot;new work&quot;</li>
<li><input disabled="" type="checkbox"> Feedback deadline (recommend: 3 business days)</li>
<li><input disabled="" type="checkbox"> Requirement for consolidated feedback</li>
<li><input disabled="" type="checkbox"> Auto-approval clause if no feedback</li>
<li><input disabled="" type="checkbox"> Price for additional revision rounds</li>
<li><input disabled="" type="checkbox"> Distinction from hook variations/format changes</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>Revision limits aren&#39;t about being difficult. They&#39;re about:</p>
<ol>
<li>Valuing your time</li>
<li>Encouraging decisive feedback</li>
<li>Keeping projects profitable</li>
<li>Setting professional expectations</li>
</ol>
<p>Two rounds is standard. Charge for more. Define what counts. And don&#39;t let &quot;just one more tweak&quot; turn your profitable project into charity work.</p>
