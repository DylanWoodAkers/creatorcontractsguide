      <h1>Brand Deal Red Flags: What Creators Should Watch For</h1>
<p><em>Last updated: February 2026</em></p>
<p>That brand sliding into your DMs might be a dream opportunity. Or it might be a nightmare waiting to happen.</p>
<p>After seeing thousands of creator-brand deals go sideways, we&#39;ve identified the warning signs that separate legitimate partnerships from scams, exploitation, and relationships you&#39;ll regret.</p>
<p>Here are the red flags to watch for — before you sign anything.</p>
<hr>
<h2>Communication Red Flags 🚩</h2>
<h3>1. They Found You Via Random DM With No Details</h3>
<p><strong>What it looks like:</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;Hey! Love your content. We&#39;d like to work with you. Interested?&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Why it&#39;s a problem:</strong> Legitimate brands and agencies usually include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Their company name</li>
<li>The specific campaign or product</li>
<li>Why they chose you</li>
<li>Basic compensation info</li>
</ul>
<p>A vague DM could be a mass-send to thousands of creators, a scam, or someone fishing for free content.</p>
<p><strong>What to do:</strong> Ask for specifics before continuing. If they can&#39;t clearly explain the opportunity, pass.</p>
<hr>
<h3>2. They Refuse to Get on a Call</h3>
<p><strong>What it looks like:</strong> All communication through DM or email, won&#39;t do a quick video chat to discuss the project.</p>
<p><strong>Why it&#39;s a problem:</strong> Real brands have real people. If they won&#39;t show their face or have a conversation, something&#39;s off.</p>
<p><strong>Exception:</strong> Some large agencies do handle everything via email, but they&#39;ll have verifiable company emails, not Gmail addresses.</p>
<hr>
<h3>3. Pressure to Decide Immediately</h3>
<p><strong>What it looks like:</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;We need an answer by end of day&quot; (when they just reached out this morning)</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Why it&#39;s a problem:</strong> Legitimate opportunities allow reasonable time for consideration. Pressure tactics are used by scammers and brands who don&#39;t want you to think too hard about bad terms.</p>
<p><strong>What to do:</strong> Any brand worth working with will give you 48-72 hours minimum. If they won&#39;t, walk away.</p>
<hr>
<h3>4. Communication From Personal Email</h3>
<p><strong>What it looks like:</strong> gmail.com, outlook.com, or other free email addresses instead of company domains.</p>
<p><strong>Why it&#39;s a problem:</strong> Real brands have company email (<a href="mailto:name@brandname.com">name@brandname.com</a>). Personal emails make it impossible to verify who you&#39;re dealing with.</p>
<p><strong>Exception:</strong> Very small startups or solo founders. But verify the brand exists independently.</p>
<hr>
<h2>Contract Red Flags 🚩</h2>
<h3>5. No Contract Offered</h3>
<p><strong>What it looks like:</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;We don&#39;t usually do contracts for projects this size&quot;
&quot;Let&#39;s just keep it casual&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Why it&#39;s a problem:</strong> No contract = no protection. If something goes wrong, you have no recourse. This isn&#39;t casual — it&#39;s your work and your money.</p>
<p><strong>What to do:</strong> Always require a written agreement, even for small projects. If they refuse, they&#39;re not serious.</p>
<hr>
<h3>6. &quot;Work for Hire&quot; Language</h3>
<p><strong>What it looks like:</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;All content created under this agreement shall be considered work for hire and the sole property of Client...&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Why it&#39;s a problem:</strong> Work for hire means the brand owns everything — your raw footage, outtakes, the final content, and potentially your likeness rights. You&#39;re giving up all ownership.</p>
<p><strong>What to do:</strong> Push for license-based language instead. You retain ownership; they receive a license to use specific content for specific purposes.</p>
<hr>
<h3>7. Unlimited Revisions</h3>
<p><strong>What it looks like:</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;Creator will make revisions until Client is satisfied&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Why it&#39;s a problem:</strong> This is a blank check for scope creep. Some brands will request endless changes, essentially getting multiple pieces of content for the price of one.</p>
<p><strong>What to do:</strong> Cap revisions at 2 rounds. Additional revisions = additional fees.</p>
<hr>
<h3>8. Perpetual, Royalty-Free, Worldwide License</h3>
<p><strong>What it looks like:</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;Client receives a perpetual, royalty-free, worldwide license to use the Content in all media now known or hereafter developed...&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Why it&#39;s a problem:</strong> Your $300 TikTok can be used forever, anywhere, for any purpose — including TV ads, billboards, and campaigns that make them millions. And you get nothing extra.</p>
<p><strong>What to do:</strong> Limit usage by time (12 months), platform (organic social only), and territory. Extended usage = extended pay.</p>
<hr>
<h3>9. Long Exclusivity Without Extra Pay</h3>
<p><strong>What it looks like:</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;Creator agrees not to work with competitors for 6 months following delivery&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Why it&#39;s a problem:</strong> You&#39;re losing income from other potential deals. Six months of exclusivity in a fast-moving creator economy is significant.</p>
<p><strong>What to do:</strong> 30 days is reasonable for base compensation. Longer exclusivity should come with substantial extra payment.</p>
<hr>
<h3>10. Vague Payment Terms</h3>
<p><strong>What it looks like:</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;Payment upon completion of campaign&quot;
&quot;Payment within reasonable timeframe&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Why it&#39;s a problem:</strong> &quot;Campaign completion&quot; could mean months. &quot;Reasonable&quot; is subjective. You need specific dates.</p>
<p><strong>What to do:</strong> Get exact payment dates (e.g., &quot;within 15 days of final delivery&quot;) and partial payment upfront.</p>
<hr>
<h2>Payment Red Flags 🚩</h2>
<h3>11. Product-Only Compensation</h3>
<p><strong>What it looks like:</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;We&#39;d love to send you our product in exchange for a video!&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Why it&#39;s a problem:</strong> Unless you actually want and would buy the product anyway, this isn&#39;t compensation — it&#39;s marketing getting free content.</p>
<p><strong>What to do:</strong> Product is nice as a bonus. It&#39;s not payment for professional work. Know your worth.</p>
<p><strong>Exception:</strong> Gifted/seeding campaigns where there&#39;s no content obligation. That&#39;s different from contracted work.</p>
<hr>
<h3>12. &quot;Exposure&quot; as Payment</h3>
<p><strong>What it looks like:</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;Think of the exposure you&#39;ll get to our 1M followers!&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Why it&#39;s a problem:</strong> Exposure doesn&#39;t pay rent. And brands with large followings can definitely afford to pay creators.</p>
<p><strong>What to do:</strong> Politely decline. Exposure is a bonus of paid work, not compensation.</p>
<hr>
<h3>13. Payment &quot;After Content Performs&quot;</h3>
<p><strong>What it looks like:</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;If your video gets 100K views, we&#39;ll pay you $500&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Why it&#39;s a problem:</strong> You&#39;re taking all the risk. Platform algorithms are unpredictable. Your work has value regardless of performance — that&#39;s the brand&#39;s problem.</p>
<p><strong>What to do:</strong> Get paid for your work, period. Performance bonuses can be on top, never instead of base pay.</p>
<hr>
<h3>14. Request for Banking Details Upfront</h3>
<p><strong>What it looks like:</strong> Asking for full banking info, SSN, or financial details before any agreement is signed.</p>
<p><strong>Why it&#39;s a problem:</strong> Could be identity theft. Legitimate brands collect payment info after contracts are signed.</p>
<p><strong>What to do:</strong> Provide payment details only after contract is signed. PayPal email is safer than bank routing numbers.</p>
<hr>
<h2>Brand Behavior Red Flags 🚩</h2>
<h3>15. They Don&#39;t Know Your Content</h3>
<p><strong>What it looks like:</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;We love your content!&quot; (but they can&#39;t name a single piece or explain why you specifically)</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Why it&#39;s a problem:</strong> Mass outreach to hundreds of creators. You&#39;re not special to them, and they probably won&#39;t treat you well.</p>
<p><strong>What to do:</strong> Ask why they chose you. If they can&#39;t answer specifically, proceed with caution.</p>
<hr>
<h3>16. Negative Reviews From Other Creators</h3>
<p><strong>What to do before any deal:</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>Search &quot;[brand name] + scam&quot; on Twitter/X</li>
<li>Search &quot;[brand name] creator&quot; on Google</li>
<li>Ask in creator communities if anyone has worked with them</li>
<li>Check if other creators are currently partnering with them</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Red flag:</strong> Multiple creators reporting non-payment, scope creep, or poor treatment.</p>
<hr>
<h3>17. They Want Content Before Contract</h3>
<p><strong>What it looks like:</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;Can you just shoot a quick draft so we can show the team?&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Why it&#39;s a problem:</strong> Once they have content, they have leverage. Some brands ghost after receiving &quot;drafts.&quot;</p>
<p><strong>What to do:</strong> Nothing gets created until the contract is signed. Mood boards and concepts are fine. Actual content is not.</p>
<hr>
<h3>18. Constantly Changing Requirements</h3>
<p><strong>What it looks like:</strong> Scope keeps shifting during negotiations, or they can&#39;t give straight answers about what they want.</p>
<p><strong>Why it&#39;s a problem:</strong> If they&#39;re disorganized now, imagine during production. You&#39;ll end up doing 3x the work for the same pay.</p>
<p><strong>What to do:</strong> Pin down exact requirements in writing before signing. If they can&#39;t commit, pass.</p>
<hr>
<h2>The &quot;Too Good to Be True&quot; Red Flag</h2>
<h3>19. Offer Seems Way Above Market Rate</h3>
<p><strong>What it looks like:</strong> A brand you&#39;ve never heard of offering $5,000 for a simple TikTok when your normal rate is $500.</p>
<p><strong>Why it&#39;s a problem:</strong> Could be a scam (they&#39;ll ask for your banking info then ghost), money laundering, or a bait-and-switch where the actual requirements are much more demanding.</p>
<p><strong>What to do:</strong> Verify the brand is real. Ask for a contract before getting excited. If it seems too good to be true, it usually is.</p>
<hr>
<h2>What to Do When You Spot Red Flags</h2>
<h3>One Red Flag: Proceed With Caution</h3>
<p>Ask clarifying questions. The issue might be miscommunication or inexperience, not malice.</p>
<h3>Two Red Flags: Negotiate Hard</h3>
<p>Get everything in writing. Push back on concerning terms. Be ready to walk.</p>
<h3>Three+ Red Flags: Walk Away</h3>
<p>Not worth the risk. There are other brands. Protect your work and mental health.</p>
<hr>
<h2>Quick Reference Checklist</h2>
<p>Before signing with any brand:</p>
<ul>
<li><input disabled="" type="checkbox"> Communication from verified company email?</li>
<li><input disabled="" type="checkbox"> Clear explanation of opportunity and why you?</li>
<li><input disabled="" type="checkbox"> Written contract provided?</li>

<li><input disabled="" type="checkbox"> Revision limits included?</li>

</ul>
<hr>
<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>Red flags exist to protect you. A great brand partnership is worth the vetting process. A bad one can cost you money, time, and mental health.</p>
<p>Trust your gut. If something feels off, it probably is. There are thousands of brands looking for creators — you don&#39;t need to work with the sketchy ones.</p>
