# Brand Deal Red Flags: What Creators Should Watch For

*Last updated: February 2026*

That brand sliding into your DMs might be a dream opportunity. Or it might be a nightmare waiting to happen.

After seeing thousands of creator-brand deals go sideways, we've identified the warning signs that separate legitimate partnerships from scams, exploitation, and relationships you'll regret.

Here are the red flags to watch for — before you sign anything.

---

## Communication Red Flags 🚩

### 1. They Found You Via Random DM With No Details

**What it looks like:**
> "Hey! Love your content. We'd like to work with you. Interested?"

**Why it's a problem:** Legitimate brands and agencies usually include:
- Their company name
- The specific campaign or product
- Why they chose you
- Basic compensation info

A vague DM could be a mass-send to thousands of creators, a scam, or someone fishing for free content.

**What to do:** Ask for specifics before continuing. If they can't clearly explain the opportunity, pass.

---

### 2. They Refuse to Get on a Call

**What it looks like:** All communication through DM or email, won't do a quick video chat to discuss the project.

**Why it's a problem:** Real brands have real people. If they won't show their face or have a conversation, something's off.

**Exception:** Some large agencies do handle everything via email, but they'll have verifiable company emails, not Gmail addresses.

---

### 3. Pressure to Decide Immediately

**What it looks like:**
> "We need an answer by end of day" (when they just reached out this morning)

**Why it's a problem:** Legitimate opportunities allow reasonable time for consideration. Pressure tactics are used by scammers and brands who don't want you to think too hard about bad terms.

**What to do:** Any brand worth working with will give you 48-72 hours minimum. If they won't, walk away.

---

### 4. Communication From Personal Email

**What it looks like:** gmail.com, outlook.com, or other free email addresses instead of company domains.

**Why it's a problem:** Real brands have company email (name@brandname.com). Personal emails make it impossible to verify who you're dealing with.

**Exception:** Very small startups or solo founders. But verify the brand exists independently.

---

## Contract Red Flags 🚩

### 5. No Contract Offered

**What it looks like:**
> "We don't usually do contracts for projects this size"
> "Let's just keep it casual"

**Why it's a problem:** No contract = no protection. If something goes wrong, you have no recourse. This isn't casual — it's your work and your money.

**What to do:** Always require a written agreement, even for small projects. If they refuse, they're not serious.

---

### 6. "Work for Hire" Language

**What it looks like:**
> "All content created under this agreement shall be considered work for hire and the sole property of Client..."

**Why it's a problem:** Work for hire means the brand owns everything — your raw footage, outtakes, the final content, and potentially your likeness rights. You're giving up all ownership.

**What to do:** Push for license-based language instead. You retain ownership; they receive a license to use specific content for specific purposes.

---

### 7. Unlimited Revisions

**What it looks like:**
> "Creator will make revisions until Client is satisfied"

**Why it's a problem:** This is a blank check for scope creep. Some brands will request endless changes, essentially getting multiple pieces of content for the price of one.

**What to do:** Cap revisions at 2 rounds. Additional revisions = additional fees.

---

### 8. Perpetual, Royalty-Free, Worldwide License

**What it looks like:**
> "Client receives a perpetual, royalty-free, worldwide license to use the Content in all media now known or hereafter developed..."

**Why it's a problem:** Your $300 TikTok can be used forever, anywhere, for any purpose — including TV ads, billboards, and campaigns that make them millions. And you get nothing extra.

**What to do:** Limit usage by time (12 months), platform (organic social only), and territory. Extended usage = extended pay.

---

### 9. Long Exclusivity Without Extra Pay

**What it looks like:**
> "Creator agrees not to work with competitors for 6 months following delivery"

**Why it's a problem:** You're losing income from other potential deals. Six months of exclusivity in a fast-moving creator economy is significant.

**What to do:** 30 days is reasonable for base compensation. Longer exclusivity should come with substantial extra payment.

---

### 10. Vague Payment Terms

**What it looks like:**
> "Payment upon completion of campaign"
> "Payment within reasonable timeframe"

**Why it's a problem:** "Campaign completion" could mean months. "Reasonable" is subjective. You need specific dates.

**What to do:** Get exact payment dates (e.g., "within 15 days of final delivery") and partial payment upfront.

---

## Payment Red Flags 🚩

### 11. Product-Only Compensation

**What it looks like:**
> "We'd love to send you our product in exchange for a video!"

**Why it's a problem:** Unless you actually want and would buy the product anyway, this isn't compensation — it's marketing getting free content.

**What to do:** Product is nice as a bonus. It's not payment for professional work. Know your worth.

**Exception:** Gifted/seeding campaigns where there's no content obligation. That's different from contracted work.

---

### 12. "Exposure" as Payment

**What it looks like:**
> "Think of the exposure you'll get to our 1M followers!"

**Why it's a problem:** Exposure doesn't pay rent. And brands with large followings can definitely afford to pay creators.

**What to do:** Politely decline. Exposure is a bonus of paid work, not compensation.

---

### 13. Payment "After Content Performs"

**What it looks like:**
> "If your video gets 100K views, we'll pay you $500"

**Why it's a problem:** You're taking all the risk. Platform algorithms are unpredictable. Your work has value regardless of performance — that's the brand's problem.

**What to do:** Get paid for your work, period. Performance bonuses can be on top, never instead of base pay.

---

### 14. Request for Banking Details Upfront

**What it looks like:** Asking for full banking info, SSN, or financial details before any agreement is signed.

**Why it's a problem:** Could be identity theft. Legitimate brands collect payment info after contracts are signed.

**What to do:** Provide payment details only after contract is signed. PayPal email is safer than bank routing numbers.

---

## Brand Behavior Red Flags 🚩

### 15. They Don't Know Your Content

**What it looks like:**
> "We love your content!" (but they can't name a single piece or explain why you specifically)

**Why it's a problem:** Mass outreach to hundreds of creators. You're not special to them, and they probably won't treat you well.

**What to do:** Ask why they chose you. If they can't answer specifically, proceed with caution.

---

### 16. Negative Reviews From Other Creators

**What to do before any deal:**
1. Search "[brand name] + scam" on Twitter/X
2. Search "[brand name] creator" on Google
3. Ask in creator communities if anyone has worked with them
4. Check if other creators are currently partnering with them

**Red flag:** Multiple creators reporting non-payment, scope creep, or poor treatment.

---

### 17. They Want Content Before Contract

**What it looks like:**
> "Can you just shoot a quick draft so we can show the team?"

**Why it's a problem:** Once they have content, they have leverage. Some brands ghost after receiving "drafts."

**What to do:** Nothing gets created until the contract is signed. Mood boards and concepts are fine. Actual content is not.

---

### 18. Constantly Changing Requirements

**What it looks like:** Scope keeps shifting during negotiations, or they can't give straight answers about what they want.

**Why it's a problem:** If they're disorganized now, imagine during production. You'll end up doing 3x the work for the same pay.

**What to do:** Pin down exact requirements in writing before signing. If they can't commit, pass.

---

## The "Too Good to Be True" Red Flag

### 19. Offer Seems Way Above Market Rate

**What it looks like:** A brand you've never heard of offering $5,000 for a simple TikTok when your normal rate is $500.

**Why it's a problem:** Could be a scam (they'll ask for your banking info then ghost), money laundering, or a bait-and-switch where the actual requirements are much more demanding.

**What to do:** Verify the brand is real. Ask for a contract before getting excited. If it seems too good to be true, it usually is.

---

## What to Do When You Spot Red Flags

### One Red Flag: Proceed With Caution
Ask clarifying questions. The issue might be miscommunication or inexperience, not malice.

### Two Red Flags: Negotiate Hard
Get everything in writing. Push back on concerning terms. Be ready to walk.

### Three+ Red Flags: Walk Away
Not worth the risk. There are other brands. Protect your work and mental health.
