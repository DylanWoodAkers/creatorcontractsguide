# How to Set Your UGC Rates (Pricing Guide 2026)

*Last updated: February 2026*

"What should I charge?"

It's the question every UGC creator asks — and the one with the most frustrating answer: "It depends."

But it doesn't have to be guesswork. This guide breaks down exactly how to price your UGC work based on real market data, your experience level, and the specific deliverables brands want.

## UGC Rate Benchmarks (2026)

Based on industry data and creator surveys, here's what the market looks like:

### By Experience Level

| Level | Follower Count | Typical Rate Per Video | Notes |
|-------|---------------|------------------------|-------|
| Beginner | <1K or UGC-only | $75-150 | Building portfolio |
| Intermediate | 1-10K or 6+ mo experience | $150-350 | Consistent quality |
| Established | 10K+ or 1+ year experience | $350-600 | Proven track record |
| Expert | Known name or agency-repped | $600-1500+ | Premium positioning |

**Note:** UGC rates are less tied to follower count than influencer rates. Your portfolio quality matters more than your numbers.

### By Deliverable Type

| Content Type | Beginner | Intermediate | Established |
|--------------|----------|--------------|-------------|
| Single TikTok/Reel (15-30 sec) | $75-150 | $150-300 | $300-500 |
| Single TikTok/Reel (30-60 sec) | $100-200 | $200-400 | $400-700 |
| Photo set (3-5 images) | $50-100 | $100-200 | $200-400 |
| Product review video | $100-200 | $200-400 | $400-800 |
| Tutorial/How-to video | $150-300 | $300-500 | $500-1000 |
| Unboxing video | $75-150 | $150-300 | $300-500 |
| Testimonial video | $100-200 | $200-400 | $400-700 |
| Raw B-roll footage (per minute) | $50-100 | $100-200 | $200-350 |

## Factors That Increase Your Rate

### Usage Rights

This is the biggest variable. The same video can be worth $150 or $1,500 depending on how the brand uses it.

| Usage Type | Rate Multiplier |
|------------|-----------------|
| Organic social only | 1x (base rate) |
| Paid ads (whitelisting) | 1.5-2x |
| Paid ads (brand's account) | 1.3-1.5x |
| Website use | 1.2-1.5x |
| Email marketing | 1.1-1.3x |
| TV/OTT advertising | 2-3x |
| Billboards/print | 2-3x |
| Perpetual license (forever) | 2-3x |
| Exclusive rights | 3-5x |

**Example:** A $200 TikTok becomes a $400-600 video if they want paid ad rights.

### Turnaround Time

Rush fees are real and justified:

| Timeline | Rate Adjustment |
|----------|-----------------|
| Standard (5-7 days) | Base rate |
| Rush (48-72 hours) | +25-50% |
| Urgent (24 hours) | +75-100% |

### Content Complexity

| Factor | Rate Adjustment |
|--------|-----------------|
| Multiple locations | +$50-150 per location |
| Multiple outfits/looks | +$25-75 per outfit |
| Other people on camera | +$50-150 per person |
| Props/set design needed | +$50-200 |
| Script provided vs. creative freedom | No change (preference varies) |
| Hook variations (3-5 per video) | +$50-100 per variation |

### Exclusivity

| Duration | Rate Adjustment |
|----------|-----------------|
| 30 days | Included in base |
| 60 days | +15-25% |
| 90 days | +30-50% |
| 6 months | +75-100% |
| 1 year+ | +150%+ |

## How to Quote a Project

### Step 1: Calculate Base Rate

Count deliverables × your per-unit rate.

**Example:** 3 TikToks at $200 each = $600 base

### Step 2: Add Usage Fees

What will they do with the content?

**Example:** Paid ad rights = +50% = $900

### Step 3: Add Complexity Fees

Rush timeline? Multiple locations? Special requirements?

**Example:** Rush (48h) = +50% = $1,350

### Step 4: Consider Exclusivity

How long can't you work with competitors?

**Example:** 90 days exclusivity = +30% = $1,755

### Step 5: Apply Bundle Discount (Optional)

For larger projects, a small discount can close the deal.

**Example:** 5% relationship discount = $1,667 final quote

## Negotiating Your Rate

### When Brands Push Back

**They say:** "That's above our budget."
**You say:** "I understand. We could reduce the usage rights to organic-only, or I can offer a smaller package. What's most important for this campaign?"

**They say:** "Other creators charge less."
**You say:** "I'm sure there are options at different price points. My rate reflects [your quality, experience, turnaround, etc]. Happy to send over my portfolio so you can see the value."

**They say:** "We can offer exposure instead."
**You say:** "I appreciate that, but I need to be compensated for my time and work. If budget is tight, I'm happy to discuss a smaller scope that works for both of us."

### When to Negotiate Down

- Dream brand you really want in your portfolio
- Long-term relationship potential (multiple campaigns)
- Simple scope with quick turnaround
- You need the work right now

### When to Hold Firm

- They have the budget (major brand)
- Complex requirements
- Tight timeline
- Exclusive rights
- They came to you specifically

## Pricing Mistakes to Avoid

### 1. Underpricing to "Get Started"

Low rates attract low-quality clients. You'll work harder, deal with more revisions, and resent the work.

**Instead:** Start at market rate for your level. Raise prices as you improve.

### 2. Forgetting Usage Rights

A video for organic social is not the same as a video for paid ads. Charge accordingly.

**Instead:** Always ask how they'll use the content. Price based on actual usage.

### 3. Quoting Before Understanding Scope

Saying "$200 per video" before knowing what they want leaves money on the table.

**Instead:** Ask questions first. Quote based on full requirements.

### 4. Not Requiring Deposits

100% on delivery means you take all the risk.

**Instead:** 50% upfront, 50% on delivery. Non-negotiable for new clients.

### 5. Comparing to Influencer Rates

Influencer campaigns price based on reach. UGC prices based on content quality and usage rights.

**Instead:** Compare to other UGC creators, not influencers.

## When to Raise Your Rates

Signs it's time:

- Booking rate above 80% (you're too cheap)
- Every brand says yes immediately
- Quality has noticeably improved
- You're getting repeat clients
- 6+ months since last increase
- Working more than you want to

**How much to raise:** 15-25% every 6-12 months is reasonable growth.

---

## Summary

Your rates should reflect your skill, the value you provide, and what the market will bear. Don't undersell yourself — but don't price yourself out of opportunities either.

Start with benchmarks, adjust for your experience and niche, and always factor in usage rights. As you build your portfolio and reputation, your rates should grow with you.
