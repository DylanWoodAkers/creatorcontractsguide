## Detailed Reviews

### 1. CreatorContracts.io

**Best for:** UGC and content creators specifically

**What it is:** Purpose-built contract templates designed specifically for content creators and UGC work. Not a monthly subscription — you buy templates and own them.

**Pros:**
- Designed specifically for creator-brand deals (not generic freelance contracts)
- Includes UGC-specific clauses: usage rights, whitelisting, content ownership
- Built-in e-sign — no need for DocuSign
- One-time purchase, no monthly fees
- Templates auto-fill with your info

**Cons:**
- Newer platform (less brand recognition)
- No project management features (it's just contracts)

**Pricing:** $29-89 depending on package

**Best clause we found:** Their usage rights section clearly defines organic vs. paid usage with automatic fee adjustments — something most templates miss entirely.

## What to Look For in a UGC Contract Template

Whatever you choose, make sure it includes:

### Must-Have Clauses

1. **Detailed scope of work** — Number of deliverables, formats, platforms
2. **Revision limits** — Don't agree to unlimited revisions
3. **Payment terms** — Amount, timeline, late fees
4. **Usage rights** — Organic, paid, duration, exclusivity
5. **Kill fee** — Compensation if they cancel mid-project
6. **Content ownership** — Who owns what, portfolio rights

### Nice-to-Have Features

- Built-in e-signature (saves time and looks professional)
- Auto-fill fields (your name, rate, etc.)
- Multiple template types (different contract for different deal types)
- PDF export
- Mobile-friendly signing

### Red Flags in Templates

🚩 No usage rights section — This is crucial for creators  
🚩 No kill fee clause — You need cancellation protection  
🚩 "Work for hire" language — Gives away all your rights  
🚩 No revision limits — Recipe for scope creep  
🚩 Last updated 2020 or earlier — Outdated for current creator economy

## Our Recommendation

**For most UGC creators:** CreatorContracts.io offers the best balance of price, creator-specific features, and ease of use. You're not paying monthly, and the templates are designed for exactly what you do.

**For full-time freelancers:** Honeybook or HelloBonsai if you want all-in-one business management beyond just contracts.

**For enterprises/agencies:** The Contract Shop for lawyer-drafted templates you can customize extensively.

**For beginners:** Start with a free template to get something in place, then upgrade as soon as you're doing regular paid work.

## How to Actually Use Your Template

Having a template is step one. Here's how to use it effectively:

1. **Customize once** — Fill in your standard info (name, payment details, base terms)
2. **Adjust per deal** — Update scope, pricing, and usage rights for each project
3. **Send before starting work** — No signed contract = no content
4. **Keep records** — Save all signed contracts in a folder organized by client
5. **Follow up** — If they don't sign within 48 hours, nudge them

---

## Summary

The best contract template is the one you'll actually use. A signed imperfect contract beats an unsigned perfect one.

For UGC creators specifically, we recommend starting with a purpose-built solution like CreatorContracts.io. For broader freelance work, Honeybook or HelloBonsai offer more features at a higher price point.

Whatever you choose, make sure it includes usage rights, kill fees, and revision limits. These three clauses alone will save you from 90% of creator nightmares.
