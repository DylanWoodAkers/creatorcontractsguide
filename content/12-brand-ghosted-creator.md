# What to Do When a Brand Ghosts You

*Last updated: February 2026*

You delivered the content. Sent the invoice. And then... silence.

Days turn into weeks. Emails go unanswered. The brand that was so enthusiastic during negotiations has vanished.

Getting ghosted by a brand is frustratingly common. Here's exactly what to do about it.

---

## Why Brands Ghost

Understanding the reasons helps you respond appropriately:

### Benign Reasons

- **Overwhelmed contact** — Your point person is buried and your invoice isn't priority
- **Internal approval delays** — Payment has to go through multiple departments
- **Budget timing** — They can only pay on certain cycles
- **Staff changes** — Your contact left and no one picked up the project

### Concerning Reasons

- **Cash flow problems** — They can't pay right now
- **Buyer's remorse** — They regret the deal but won't say it
- **Intentional avoidance** — They're hoping you'll give up
- **Scam from the start** — Never intended to pay

## The Ghost Timeline

How long before it's actually ghosting?

| Situation | Normal Wait | Concern Point | Ghost Confirmed |
|-----------|-------------|---------------|-----------------|
| Awaiting response to pitch | 3-5 days | 7 days | 14+ days |
| Awaiting contract signing | 3-5 days | 10 days | 14+ days |
| Awaiting feedback on draft | 3-5 days | 7 days | 10+ days |
| Awaiting payment (Net 15) | 15 days | 20 days | 30+ days |
| Awaiting payment (Net 30) | 30 days | 35 days | 45+ days |

## Step-by-Step: What to Do

### Stage 1: The Benefit of the Doubt (Days 1-7)

**Assumption:** They're busy, not malicious.

**Action:** Send a friendly follow-up.

**Email template:**
> Subject: Following up on [Project Name]
>
> Hi [Name],
>
> Hope you're doing well! Just following up on [the invoice / our last conversation / the draft I sent].
>
> Let me know if you need anything from my end.
>
> Best,
> [Your name]

**When to send:** 3-5 business days after last contact.

---

### Stage 2: The Clear Ask (Days 7-14)

**Assumption:** Message got lost or deprioritized.

**Action:** Be more direct. Request specific response.

**Email template:**
> Subject: Re: [Project Name] - Action Needed
>
> Hi [Name],
>
> I wanted to follow up again regarding [specific issue - payment/feedback/contract].
>
> Could you confirm:
> 1. Receipt of [invoice/content/etc.]
> 2. Expected timeline for [payment/response]
>
> Please let me know by [specific date] so I can update my records.
>
> Thanks,
> [Your name]

**Also try:**
- Different contact at the company
- Their official support/finance email
- LinkedIn message to your contact

---

### Stage 3: The Formal Notice (Days 14-30)

**Assumption:** There's a real problem.

**Action:** Formal communication documenting the issue.

**Email template:**
> Subject: Formal Notice: Outstanding Payment - [Invoice #]
>
> Dear [Name/Company],
>
> This is a formal notice regarding the outstanding payment for [Project Name].
>
> Details:
> - Invoice #: [Number]
> - Invoice Date: [Date]
> - Amount Due: $[Amount]
> - Due Date: [Original due date]
> - Days Overdue: [X] days
>
> Per our agreement dated [contract date], payment was due within [X] days of delivery. The content was delivered on [delivery date].
>
> Please remit payment within 7 business days to avoid further action.
>
> I have attached copies of:
> - Original contract
> - Invoice
> - Delivery confirmation
>
> Please confirm receipt of this notice.
>
> Regards,
> [Your name]

**Send via:**
- Email (with read receipt if possible)
- Certified mail to company address (for larger amounts)

---

### Stage 4: Escalation (Days 30+)

**Assumption:** They're not going to pay without pressure.

**Options:**

**1. Contact their accounts payable directly**
Find the finance/AP department email. Your contact may not have payment authority.

**2. Reach out to leadership**
Find the CEO or Marketing Director on LinkedIn. A professional message about an unpaid invoice often gets fast results.

**3. Public accountability (careful here)**
- Share (factually) in creator communities
- Some creators tweet about non-payment — this can work but burns bridges

**4. Collections or legal**
For amounts over $500:
- Send formal demand letter (templates online)
- Small claims court ($30-100 filing fee, no lawyer needed)
- Collection agency (they take 25-50%, but something > nothing)

## The Demand Letter

A demand letter is a formal document that often triggers payment. Many people pay once they realize you're serious.

**Template:**

```
[Your Name]
[Your Address]
[Date]

[Company Name]
[Company Address]

RE: DEMAND FOR PAYMENT

Dear [Company Name],

I am writing to demand payment for services rendered under our agreement dated [Date].

SUMMARY OF CLAIM:
- Services: [Description of work]
- Invoice Amount: $[Amount]
- Invoice Date: [Date]
- Payment Due Date: [Date]
- Amount Currently Owed: $[Amount + any late fees per contract]

Despite multiple attempts to resolve this matter, payment remains outstanding. I have attached copies of the signed agreement, invoice, and delivery confirmation.

DEMAND:
I demand payment in full within 10 days of this letter. If payment is not received by [Date], I will pursue all available legal remedies, including but not limited to:
- Filing in small claims court
- Reporting to credit bureaus
- Publicizing this matter in professional communities

This is not a threat; it is a statement of my intent to exercise my legal rights.

Please remit payment to:
[Payment details]

Sincerely,
[Your Signature]
[Your Name]
```

## Preventing Future Ghosting

### Before the Project

1. **Vet the brand** — Search "[brand] + creator + payment" before signing
2. **Require deposits** — 50% upfront is standard. No deposit = no work
3. **Use contracts** — Written agreements are your protection
4. **Set clear payment terms** — Specific dates, not "upon completion"

### During the Project

1. **Watermark previews** — Never send final content before payment/approval
2. **Document everything** — Email confirmations, not just DM conversations
3. **Invoice immediately** — Don't wait weeks after delivery

### In Your Contract

Include these ghost-prevention clauses:

**Payment deadline:**
> "Payment is due within 15 days of final delivery. Invoices unpaid after 30 days will incur a 5% monthly late fee."

**Kill fee:**
> "If Client becomes unresponsive for 14+ days during production, Creator may terminate the agreement and invoice for work completed."

**Deposit policy:**
> "A 50% deposit is required before Creator begins work. Deposit is non-refundable."

## What NOT to Do

### Don't Threaten Immediately

Aggressive first emails burn bridges. The contact might just be on vacation.

### Don't Post Publicly Too Early

Trashing a brand online before exhausting private options looks unprofessional and can backfire.

### Don't Give Up Too Easily

Some creators walk away from hundreds of dollars because follow-up feels awkward. Your work has value. Chase it.

### Don't Keep Working

If they ghost mid-project, stop working immediately. No more content until communication resumes.

---

## When to Let It Go

Sometimes the juice isn't worth the squeeze:

- **Amount is very small** (<$100) and time invested in chasing would exceed recovery
- **Brand is clearly defunct** (website down, social inactive)
- **You have no contract** — lesson learned, move on
- **Mental health cost** — some battles aren't worth fighting

But for legitimate amounts with proper documentation? Fight for your money.

## Scripts for Common Situations

### "We're Still Reviewing Internally"

> "Understood. When can I expect a final decision? I'll mark [date] on my calendar for follow-up if I haven't heard back."

### "Budget Got Cut"

> "I understand budget situations change. The work was completed per our agreement, so the invoice remains due. Can we discuss a payment plan if needed?"

### "We Decided Not to Use the Content"

> "I understand. Per our agreement, payment is for the creation and delivery of content, not contingent on use. The invoice remains due."

### No Response at All

After 30 days, send the demand letter. No more friendly emails.

---

## Summary

Getting ghosted sucks, but it's manageable:

1. **Days 1-7:** Friendly follow-up
2. **Days 7-14:** Direct ask with deadline
3. **Days 14-30:** Formal notice
4. **Days 30+:** Escalation (demand letter, small claims)

Prevention is better than cure: vet brands, require deposits, use contracts, and never deliver final content before securing payment.
