# Revision Limits: How Many is Too Many?

*Last updated: February 2026*

"Just one more tweak."

Famous last words before your $200 project turns into $50/hour work.

Revisions without limits are how creators lose money on every deal. Here's how to set boundaries that protect your time while still delivering great work.

## Why Revision Limits Matter

### The Math Problem

Without limits:
- You quote $300 for a video
- You estimate 3 hours of work
- That's $100/hour — great!

With "unlimited revisions":
- First draft: 3 hours
- Revision 1: 1 hour
- Revision 2: 1.5 hours
- Revision 3: 2 hours
- Revision 4: 1 hour
- "One more tweak": 0.5 hours

Total: 9 hours. That's $33/hour.

Suddenly your great rate is below minimum wage for skilled creative work.

### The Psychology Problem

Unlimited revisions signal:
- You don't value your time
- The client can keep pushing
- "Perfect" is the goal (it never is)

Limited revisions signal:
- Your time has value
- There's a process to follow
- Decisions need to be made

## Industry Standards

### What's Normal

| Creator Level | Included Revisions |
|---------------|-------------------|
| Beginner | 2 rounds |
| Intermediate | 2 rounds |
| Established | 1-2 rounds |
| Premium | 1 round |

Yes — the more experienced you are, the fewer revisions you include. Because:
1. Your work is higher quality initially
2. Your time is more valuable
3. Clients who work with pros are more decisive

### 2 Rounds Is Standard

For most creator work, 2 rounds of revisions is industry standard. This gives clients:
- Round 1: Major feedback and direction changes
- Round 2: Minor tweaks and final polish

If the content isn't right after 2 rounds, either the brief was bad or there's a bigger problem.

## What Counts as a Revision?

This is where problems happen. Define it clearly.

### A Revision IS:

- Feedback on the existing concept
- Color correction requests
- Text/caption changes
- Minor timing adjustments
- Audio level tweaks
- Small edits to existing footage

### A Revision IS NOT:

- Complete concept change ("Actually, let's try something different")
- New script or messaging
- Re-shoot with different products
- Major structural overhaul
- Adding new deliverables

### Contract Language

> **Definition:** A "revision" means modifications to existing content based on Client feedback. Requests for new concepts, complete re-shoots, additional deliverables, or fundamental changes to creative direction constitute new work and will be quoted separately.

---

## Structuring Your Revision Process

### The Feedback Window

Give clients a deadline to provide feedback:

> "Client has 3 business days to provide consolidated feedback on each draft. All feedback must be provided in a single communication (email or document). Feedback received after 3 business days or in multiple communications may be treated as an additional revision round."

**Why "consolidated"?** 

Without this, clients send 10 emails over 5 days with one note each. That's chaos, not one revision.

### The Auto-Approval Clause

> "If Creator does not receive feedback within 5 business days of draft delivery, the draft is considered approved. Creator will proceed to final delivery."

This prevents projects from stalling because someone can't make decisions.

## Pricing Additional Revisions

### Flat Fee Per Round

> "Additional revision rounds: $75 per round"

**Pros:** Simple, predictable
**Cons:** May not cover time on complex changes

### Percentage of Project Fee

> "Additional revision rounds: 15% of project total per round"

**Pros:** Scales with project size
**Cons:** Math is messier

### Hourly Rate

> "Additional revisions beyond included rounds will be billed at $100/hour"

**Pros:** True compensation for time
**Cons:** Client doesn't know cost upfront

### Recommended

For most creators: **Flat fee of $50-100 per round** is simple and effective.

## Sample Revision Clauses

### Basic Clause

> **Revisions:** This project includes 2 rounds of revisions. Additional revision rounds are available at $75 per round.

### Detailed Clause

> **Revision Policy:**
>
> 1. Creator will deliver initial draft within [X] days of project start.
> 2. Client has 3 business days to provide consolidated written feedback.
> 3. Creator will complete revisions within 2 business days of receiving feedback.
> 4. This cycle repeats for up to 2 rounds (included in project fee).
> 5. Additional revision rounds: $[X] per round.
> 6. Requests for new concepts, re-shoots, or fundamental creative changes are not revisions — they are new deliverables and will be quoted separately.
> 7. If no feedback is received within 5 business days, content is considered approved.

### Premium Clause (1 Round Only)

> **Revisions:** This project includes 1 round of revisions based on a single, consolidated feedback document. 
>
> The revision will address specific, actionable notes within the existing creative direction. Requests for conceptual overhauls, new angles, or fundamental changes require a new project scope.
>
> Additional revision rounds: $[X] each, if available in Creator's schedule.

## Handling Revision Requests

### When They Want "One More Thing"

**They say:** "Can we just tweak the intro?"

**You say:** "We've completed our 2 included revision rounds. I can do another revision for $75 — should I proceed?"

### When They Want a Complete Redo

**They say:** "Actually, we want to go in a totally different direction."

**You say:** "A new creative direction would be a separate project from our original scope. I'd be happy to quote that for you. Shall I send a proposal?"

### When Feedback Keeps Trickling In

**They say:** (Email 1) "Can you change the text?"
(Email 2, 3 hours later) "Also the music"
(Email 3, next day) "And maybe try a different hook?"

**You say:** "I'd like to address all your feedback in one revision round. Could you send me a consolidated list of everything you'd like changed? I'll wait for your complete notes before making updates."

### When They're Never Satisfied

**Signs:**
- 4+ revision rounds
- Contradictory feedback
- "I'll know it when I see it"

**You say:** "We've gone through several rounds now, and I want to make sure we're aligned on the vision. Let's schedule a 15-minute call to discuss exactly what you're looking for before I make more changes."

If that doesn't work:
- Deliver best version
- Invoice in full
- Move on

## Special Cases

### Hook Variations

Many brands want multiple hooks for A/B testing. This is NOT a revision — it's a deliverable.

> "Package includes 1 video with 1 hook. Additional hook variations: $[X] each."

Or build it in:
> "Package includes 3 hook variations per video."

### Platform Variations

Different aspect ratios or lengths for different platforms = different deliverables, not revisions.

> "Deliverables: 1 video in 9:16 (TikTok/Reels). Additional formats (16:9, 1:1, 4:5): $[X] each."

### Raw Footage Requests

Not a revision. Separate deliverable.

> "Raw footage and B-roll: $[X] for full project footage."

---

## Protecting Yourself

### Document Everything

- Save all feedback emails
- Keep version history
- Screenshot DM conversations
- Track which round you're on

### Be Proactive

After each revision, confirm:
> "I've completed the changes based on your feedback. This was revision round [X] of [Y] included. Let me know if this is approved or if you have any final notes!"

This reminds them of limits without being confrontational.

### Know When to Fire Clients

Some clients will never be happy. Signs:
- More than 4 revision rounds requested
- Feedback contradicts previous feedback
- Refusal to consolidate notes
- "I can't describe it but I'll know it"

Your contract protects you. Use it. Deliver the best version you can, invoice, and decline future work.

---

## Revision Clause Checklist

Your contract should specify:

- [ ] Number of included revision rounds (recommend: 2)
- [ ] Definition of "revision" vs. "new work"
- [ ] Feedback deadline (recommend: 3 business days)
- [ ] Requirement for consolidated feedback
- [ ] Auto-approval clause if no feedback
- [ ] Price for additional revision rounds
- [ ] Distinction from hook variations/format changes

---

## Summary

Revision limits aren't about being difficult. They're about:
1. Valuing your time
2. Encouraging decisive feedback
3. Keeping projects profitable
4. Setting professional expectations

Two rounds is standard. Charge for more. Define what counts. And don't let "just one more tweak" turn your profitable project into charity work.
