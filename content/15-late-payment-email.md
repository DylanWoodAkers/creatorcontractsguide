## Pro Tips for Chasing Payments

### Always Be Professional

Angry emails feel satisfying. They don't get you paid. Keep every communication professional — it may end up in court.

### Document Everything

Save every email, every agreement, every delivery confirmation. Screenshot DMs before they disappear.

### Try Multiple Contacts

Your marketing contact might not have payment authority. Try:
- Accounts Payable email
- Finance department
- CEO or founder (LinkedIn works)
- General company email

### Invoice Immediately

Don't wait weeks after delivery to invoice. Send it the same day you deliver final content.

### Include Payment Terms on Invoice

Every invoice should state:
- Due date
- Late fee policy (from your contract)
- Payment methods accepted

### Consider Payment Upfront

For new clients, 100% upfront (or 50% deposit) eliminates the chase entirely. Offer this for smaller projects.

## When to Escalate to Small Claims

**Consider small claims when:**
- Amount is significant ($500+)
- You have clear documentation (contract, invoice, delivery proof)
- They've refused to pay or ghosted completely
- Amount is within small claims limit (varies by state, usually $5,000-$10,000)

**Small claims basics:**
- Filing fee: $30-100
- No lawyer needed
- You represent yourself
- Bring all documentation
- Judgment is enforceable

**Warning:** Even with a judgment, collecting can be difficult from some companies. Weigh the time investment.

## Prevention Is Better Than Cure

### In Your Contract

- Net 15 or Net 30 (not "upon completion")
- 5% monthly late fee
- Kill fee for cancellations
- Deposit required (50% or 100% for new clients)

### In Your Process

- Vet new clients before signing
- Invoice same day as delivery
- Use watermarked previews until payment/approval
- Track all invoices in a spreadsheet

## Late Payment Email Checklist

Before sending:
- [ ] Reference specific invoice number
- [ ] State exact amount due
- [ ] Include original due date
- [ ] Calculate days overdue
- [ ] Attach invoice copy
- [ ] Include payment link/details
- [ ] Set clear deadline for response
- [ ] Keep tone professional

---

## Summary

Chasing payments is uncomfortable but necessary. The key is having a system:

1. **Friendly reminder** at 3 days
2. **Direct follow-up** at 7 days
3. **Firm request** at 14 days
4. **Final notice** at 21 days
5. **Demand letter** at 30 days

Stay professional, document everything, and don't be afraid to escalate. Your work has value — fight for it.
