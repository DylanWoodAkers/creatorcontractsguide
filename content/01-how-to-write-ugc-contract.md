# How to Write a UGC Contract (Complete Guide for 2026)

*Last updated: February 2026*

You landed a brand deal. Congrats. Now comes the part nobody talks about: the contract.

Most creators skip this step entirely, or worse, sign whatever the brand sends without reading it. Six months later, they're wondering why their face is on a billboard and they haven't seen a dime.

This guide walks you through exactly how to write a UGC contract that protects you, gets you paid, and keeps brands from exploiting your work.

## Why You Need a Written Contract (Even for Small Deals)

"It's just a $200 gig, do I really need a contract?"

Yes. Here's why:

1. **Verbal agreements are unenforceable.** If a brand ghosts you after receiving content, you have no legal recourse without written terms.

2. **Scope creep is real.** "Can you just add one more video?" turns into three more videos, four rounds of revisions, and zero extra pay.

3. **Usage rights matter.** That TikTok you made for $300 could end up in TV ads, billboards, and paid campaigns — making the brand thousands while you got nothing extra.

4. **Professionalism closes deals.** Brands work with hundreds of creators. The ones who show up with contracts get taken seriously.

The contract doesn't need to be 20 pages of legalese. It needs to be clear, specific, and signed by both parties.

## The 8 Essential Elements of a UGC Contract

Every creator contract should include these sections:

### 1. Parties Involved

State who's making the agreement:

> **Creator:** [Your legal name or business name]  
> **Client:** [Brand name and legal entity]  
> **Effective Date:** [Date both parties sign]

If the brand is using an agency, clarify who you're actually contracting with — and who's responsible for payment.

### 2. Scope of Work

This is the most important section. Be painfully specific:

- **Number of deliverables:** "3 TikTok videos, 15-30 seconds each"
- **Content type:** UGC, testimonial, tutorial, unboxing, etc.
- **Platforms:** Where will this content be posted?
- **Format requirements:** Aspect ratio, resolution, with/without text
- **Timeline:** Draft due date, revision period, final delivery date

**Bad example:** "Creator will produce content for Client's social media."

**Good example:** "Creator will produce 3 vertical videos (9:16, 1080x1920) for TikTok, each 20-30 seconds, featuring [Product Name]. Draft deliverables due by [Date]. Final versions due within 5 business days of receiving feedback."

### 3. Revisions Policy

Unlimited revisions is a trap. Set clear limits:

> Creator will provide up to **2 rounds of revisions** at no additional cost. Each additional revision round will be billed at $[X] per round.

What counts as a revision? Define it:

- A revision is feedback on the existing concept
- A complete re-shoot or new concept is a **new deliverable** (additional fee)

### 4. Payment Terms

Get this in writing:

- **Total fee:** $X for the complete scope of work
- **Payment schedule:** 50% upfront, 50% on delivery (or 100% upfront for new clients)
- **Payment method:** PayPal, bank transfer, etc.
- **Due date:** Payment due within X days of invoice (Net 15 or Net 30)
- **Late fees:** "Invoices unpaid after 30 days will incur a 5% monthly late fee"

**Pro tip:** Never deliver final, unwatermarked content before receiving at least partial payment. Use watermarked previews for approval.

### 5. Usage Rights

This determines how the brand can use your content — and it directly impacts what you should charge.

**Types of usage:**

| Usage Type | What It Means | Price Impact |
|------------|---------------|--------------|
| Organic only | Brand's own social feeds | Base rate |
| Paid/whitelisting | Ads run from your account | +50-100% |
| Paid (brand's account) | Ads run from their account | +30-50% |
| Perpetual license | They can use it forever | +100-200% |
| Exclusive | They own it, you can't reuse | +200%+ |

**Standard clause:**

> Client is granted a **non-exclusive license** to use the Content on their owned social media channels (Instagram, TikTok, Facebook) for a period of **12 months** from delivery date. Usage in paid advertising requires separate written agreement and additional compensation.

### 6. Kill Fee

What happens if the brand cancels after you've started work?

> If Client cancels this agreement after Creator has begun work:
> - Cancellation before draft delivery: 25% of total fee due
> - Cancellation after draft delivery: 50% of total fee due
> - Cancellation after final delivery: 100% of total fee due

This protects your time. You blocked out your schedule, turned down other work, and started creating. You deserve compensation even if they change their mind.

### 7. Content Ownership and Creator Rights

Clarify what happens to the content:

> Creator retains ownership of all raw footage and outtakes. Client receives a license to use the final delivered Content as specified in this agreement.
>
> Creator may use delivered Content in their portfolio and on their social media channels unless otherwise agreed in writing.

This matters for your portfolio. You want to be able to show this work to future clients.

### 8. Confidentiality and Exclusivity

Some brands require NDAs or exclusivity:

**Confidentiality:** Can you talk about this partnership publicly? Post behind-the-scenes?

**Exclusivity:** Are you prohibited from working with competitors? For how long?

> Creator agrees not to create sponsored content for direct competitors of Client for a period of **30 days** following delivery of final Content.

**Warning:** Extended exclusivity (3-6+ months) should come with significant additional compensation. You're losing income from other potential deals.

## Contract Templates and Tools

You have a few options:

**DIY route:**
- Google Docs template (free but not legally reviewed)
- Canva contract templates (pretty but often missing key clauses)

**Professional options:**
- Hire a lawyer to draft one ($500-2000, but you own it forever)
- Use a specialized platform like CreatorContracts.io, Honeybook, or HelloBonsai
- Legal template marketplaces like LegalZoom or Rocket Lawyer

The best option depends on your volume. If you're doing 2-3 deals per year, a simple template works. If you're doing 20+ deals, invest in something more robust.

## Red Flags to Watch For in Brand Contracts

When a brand sends you their contract, watch for these:

🚩 **"Work for hire" language** — This means they own everything outright, including content you haven't even created yet

🚩 **Unlimited revisions** — Recipe for endless scope creep

🚩 **"Perpetual, worldwide, royalty-free license"** — They can use your face and content forever, anywhere, for any purpose

🚩 **Payment "upon campaign completion"** — Could be months; get specific dates

🚩 **Non-compete longer than 30 days** — You shouldn't be locked out of your industry for months

🚩 **Indemnification clauses** — You're agreeing to cover their legal costs if something goes wrong

**You can negotiate.** Most brands expect pushback. Cross out what you don't like and propose alternatives.

## How to Send Your Contract

1. **Create the contract** using one of the methods above
2. **Fill in the specifics** from your negotiations with the brand
3. **Send for signature** via email or e-sign platform (DocuSign, HelloSign, or built-in e-sign)
4. **Get it signed before starting work** — No signature, no content
5. **Save a copy** for your records

**Email template:**

> Hi [Brand Contact],
>
> Thanks for confirming the details for this project! Attached is the agreement covering our scope of work, timeline, and payment terms.
>
> Please review and sign at your convenience. Happy to discuss if you have any questions.
>
> Looking forward to creating great content together!
>
> [Your Name]

## Common Questions

**Q: What if the brand already has their own contract?**

Read it carefully. You can request changes or add an addendum with your terms. If they refuse to negotiate on important points (payment terms, usage rights), that's a red flag.

**Q: Should I use a contract for every deal?**

Yes. Even small deals. Especially with new clients. The one time you skip it will be the one time you get burned.

**Q: What if I already delivered content without a contract?**

Send an invoice immediately that includes your terms. "Payment of this invoice constitutes agreement to the following terms: [basic usage rights, payment deadline]." It's not as strong as a signed contract, but it's something.

**Q: Can I write my own contract or do I need a lawyer?**

You can absolutely start with a template and customize it. For high-value deals ($5k+), consider having a lawyer review it. For standard UGC work, a good template is sufficient.
