# 10 Clauses Every Creator Contract Needs

*Last updated: February 2026*

That contract you're about to sign? It's probably missing something important.

Most creator contracts — whether sent by brands or copied from a free template — leave out critical protections. One missing clause can cost you thousands of dollars or leave your content being used in ways you never agreed to.

Here are the 10 clauses that belong in every creator contract, explained in plain English.

---

## 1. Scope of Work (The "What Exactly Am I Doing?" Clause)

**Why it matters:** Prevents scope creep and "can you just add one more thing?" syndrome.

**What to include:**
- Exact number of deliverables
- Content format (video, photo, stories, etc.)
- Platform specifications
- Length/duration requirements
- Specific products or topics covered

**Bad example:**
> "Creator will produce content for Brand's social media channels."

**Good example:**
> "Creator will produce 3 vertical videos (9:16 aspect ratio, 1080x1920, 20-30 seconds each) featuring [Product Name] for use on TikTok and Instagram Reels. Content will demonstrate [specific use case]."

**The rule:** If it's not written, it's not included.

---

## 2. Revision Limits (The "No Endless Changes" Clause)

**Why it matters:** Without this, brands can request unlimited revisions until your content looks nothing like your style.

**What to include:**
- Number of included revision rounds (2 is standard)
- Definition of what counts as a revision vs. new content
- Fee for additional revisions

**Example clause:**
> "Scope includes up to 2 rounds of revisions based on Client feedback. Each additional revision round will be billed at $[X]. Requests for new concepts or complete re-shoots constitute new deliverables and will be quoted separately."

**Pro tip:** Feedback must be consolidated. "I'll send notes throughout the week" is not one revision round — it's chaos.

---

## 3. Payment Terms (The "When Do I Get Paid?" Clause)

**Why it matters:** "Payment upon completion" means nothing if they never define completion.

**What to include:**
- Total compensation amount
- Payment schedule (50% upfront / 50% on delivery is standard)
- Payment method
- Invoice timeline (Net 15, Net 30)
- Late payment penalties

**Example clause:**
> "Total compensation: $[X]. Payment schedule: 50% ($[X]) due upon signing, 50% ($[X]) due within 7 days of final delivery. Late payments will incur a 5% monthly fee. Payment via [PayPal/bank transfer]."

**Never do:** 100% on completion with a new client. Always get something upfront.

---

## 4. Usage Rights (The "How Can They Use My Content?" Clause)

**Why it matters:** This determines whether your $300 TikTok ends up in a $50,000 ad campaign — and whether you get paid for it.

**What to include:**
- Platforms where content can be used
- Organic vs. paid advertising rights
- Duration of license (6 months, 12 months, perpetual)
- Geographic scope
- Exclusivity or non-exclusivity

**Usage tiers (price accordingly):**

| Usage Type | Description | Price Impact |
|------------|-------------|--------------|
| Organic | Brand's social feeds only | Base rate |
| Whitelisting | Paid ads from creator's account | +50-100% |
| Paid (brand account) | Paid ads from brand's account | +30-50% |
| Extended term | Beyond 12 months | +25-50% per year |
| Perpetual | Forever | +100-200% |
| Exclusive | You can't reuse or show it | +200%+ |

**Example clause:**
> "Client receives a non-exclusive license to use the Content on their owned Instagram and TikTok accounts for organic posting for a period of 12 months from delivery. Usage in paid advertising, on additional platforms, or beyond 12 months requires separate written agreement and additional compensation."

---

## 5. Kill Fee (The "What If They Cancel?" Clause)

**Why it matters:** You blocked your schedule, researched the brand, and started creating. If they pull the plug, you deserve compensation.

**What to include:**
- Percentage of fee due at each stage of cancellation
- Clear definitions of each stage

**Example clause:**
> "If Client terminates this agreement:
> - Before Creator begins work: No fee due
> - After work begins, before draft delivery: 25% of total fee due
> - After draft delivery, before final approval: 50% of total fee due  
> - After final delivery: 100% of total fee due"

**Why brands accept this:** Professional brands understand this. If they balk at a kill fee, that's a red flag about how they treat creators.

---

## 6. Content Ownership (The "Who Owns What?" Clause)

**Why it matters:** Clarifies rights to raw footage, outtakes, and whether you can use the work in your portfolio.

**What to include:**
- Who owns raw footage
- Who owns final delivered content
- Your right to use in portfolio/self-promotion
- What happens to unused concepts

**Example clause:**
> "Creator retains ownership of all raw footage, outtakes, and unused concepts. Client receives a license (as defined in Usage Rights) to the final delivered Content only. Creator may use final Content in their portfolio and social media unless otherwise agreed in writing."

**Watch out for:** "Work for hire" language gives the brand full ownership of everything, including stuff you haven't created yet.

---

## 7. Exclusivity (The "Can I Work With Competitors?" Clause)

**Why it matters:** Long exclusivity periods lock you out of income without compensation.

**What to include:**
- Duration of exclusivity (30 days is reasonable, 6 months is aggressive)
- Definition of "competitor" 
- Additional compensation for extended exclusivity

**Example clause:**
> "Creator agrees not to create sponsored content for direct competitors of Client for 30 days following final delivery. 'Direct competitor' means [specific category] brands. Extended exclusivity available at $[X] per additional month."

**Rule of thumb:** Exclusivity over 30 days should come with significant extra payment.

---

## 8. Approval Process (The "How Do We Sign Off?" Clause)

**Why it matters:** Prevents "well, I never officially approved it" disputes and establishes clear timelines.

**What to include:**
- Timeline for client feedback
- What happens if they don't respond
- Format for delivering feedback

**Example clause:**
> "Client has 3 business days to provide consolidated feedback on each draft. Failure to respond within 3 business days constitutes approval. All feedback must be provided in writing (email acceptable)."

**Pro tip:** "Failure to respond = approval" protects you from clients who ghost mid-project.

---

## 9. Confidentiality (The "What Can I Talk About?" Clause)

**Why it matters:** Some brands require NDAs. You need to know what you can and can't share.

**What to include:**
- What's considered confidential
- What you can share publicly (behind-the-scenes, partnership announcements)
- Duration of confidentiality

**Example clause:**
> "Creator agrees to keep confidential any non-public product information, launch dates, and strategy details shared during this engagement. Creator may announce the partnership on their social channels after [date] and share behind-the-scenes content with Client approval."

**Note:** Reasonable confidentiality is fine. "You can never mention you worked with us" is weird — avoid it.

---

## 10. Dispute Resolution (The "What If Something Goes Wrong?" Clause)

**Why it matters:** Hopefully you never need this, but if things go south, you want a clear path forward.

**What to include:**
- Governing law (which state/country's laws apply)
- Resolution method (mediation, arbitration, or courts)
- Who pays for dispute resolution

**Example clause:**
> "This agreement shall be governed by the laws of [State/Country]. Any disputes arising from this agreement shall first be addressed through good-faith negotiation, then mediation, before pursuing legal action."

---

## Bonus: The "Red Flags" Clause Checklist

If a brand's contract includes any of these, push back:

🚩 **Unlimited revisions** — Counter with 2 rounds included  
🚩 **Perpetual, royalty-free, worldwide license** — Negotiate time limits or extra pay  
🚩 **Work for hire** — Counter with license-based language  
🚩 **Payment upon campaign completion** — Get specific dates and partial upfront  
🚩 **6+ month exclusivity without extra pay** — Negotiate shorter or more money  
🚩 **Indemnification** — Understand what you're agreeing to cover

## Summary

These 10 clauses aren't legal overkill — they're basic protection. The best time to negotiate is before you've done the work, not after you're chasing payment.

A professional brand will respect a creator who knows their worth and protects their work. If they don't? That tells you everything you need to know.
